#Introduction

##Welcome!

Welcome to the McKone laboratory! This handbook is intended as a detailed source for relevant information on McKone lab objectives, policies, guides, and procedures.

Prof. McKone was motivated to begin writing this document prior to his arrival at Pitt because university researchers face daily choices regarding what to do and how to do it that influence their overall success, but expectations and advice are often communicated implicitly, unclearly, or inconsistently between advisors and lab members. This handbook, then, is an effort to make expectations and advice as clear as possible, and to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about “how we do things" across multiple generations of McKone group researchers.

##Research Summary

We conduct experimental research that incorporates multiple disciplines
within the chemical sciences including chemistry, chemical
engineering, materials science, and solid-state physics. We are focused
on addressing interesting and important challenges related to
environmental and societal sustainability. Our ultimate goal is to
develop and improve technologies that positively impact the world around
us. We work toward this goal by taking an approach to research that can be
summarized as follows:

1.  Identify a problem or challenge that we would like to address

2.  Become familiar with historical factors, including the origin of the
    problem and previous/current attempts to solve it

3.  Develop a detailed understanding of the basic physical and chemical
    processes underlying the challenge

4.  Propose a technical advance that will (a) contribute to better
    understanding the problem or (b) take a tangible step toward solving it

5.  Carry out experiments to realize that technical advance

6.  Disseminate our findings openly to a wide audience

This approach is carried out in the context of another set of guiding
principles regarding our behavior as researchers. Specifically, every
day we try to:

-   Encourage each other and our peers

-   Pursue work that is interesting and fun

-   Engage with technical and non-technical audiences

Our group has extensive expertise and research tools in the
areas of electrochemistry, inorganic materials, and photochemistry. All
of the research that we are currently working on incorporates one or
more of the above areas of expertise. However, we are always interested
in collaborations or new ideas that provide opportunities to
expand our expertise!

##Group Website

The most up-to-date information on current group membership, ongoing
research projects, equipment availability and administration, and much
more will be made available on our group website, which will be up and running very soon.

##Operating Procedures and Instructions

We are continuously updating and expanding our library of operating procedures and instructions for experiments and activities in and out of the lab. These documents are numerous and they would quickly dwarf the already substantial content of this handbook. Therefore operating procedures and instructions are available on request from Prof. McKone, and they will be uploaded later to a group web repository attached to our website.

#Laboratory Rules and Policies

This section of the handbook covers specific rules and policies for
research carried out in the McKone lab, including safety, work schedule,
time off, behavioral expectations, and consequences for failure to
follow the proscribed rules.

##Safety

We make it the highest possible priority to provide and maintain a safe
working environment.
The university and department have a robust set of safety policies that apply to all research groups.
The following section discusses additional safety policies that are in effect for the McKone lab.

### Equipment and Tools

Safe operation of equipment and tools requires knowledge of the working
principles of the apparatus and training for each user. Each piece of
equipment administrated by our research lab has one or more designated
administrators (Prof. McKone is also an administrator for all equipment)
who are allowed to train novice users. These trainings are to be
scheduled directly with the equipment administrator.

In general, training procedures follow a model of three repetitions in
the progression, “I do---we do---you do."
This means that the trainee first watches the administrator operate the equipment, then the trainee and administrator operate the equipment together, and finally the trainee operates the equipment alone with supervision from the administrator.
After safely and successfully operating the equipment alone, the user is considered to be trained.
We require written documentation attesting to your
training status for each piece of equipment, which will be provided and
filled out by the administrator. We also maintain logs for most of our
equipment for the purpose of monitoring usage patterns and maintenance
issues. These logs are to be scrupulously maintained regardless of the
nature of your instrument usage (e.g. even if you are just running a
“quick experiment").

Researchers are **never** allowed to use any instrument for which they
have not been trained. Regardless of training status, every user must
obey all standard operating procedures and posted rules at all times.
Failure to comply with rules and operating procedures may result in
revocation of your “trained" status at the discretion of an
administrator, effectively prohibiting you from using the instrument. If
your trained status is revoked, you must consult with an administrator
before you may resume using an instrument. Additionally, users who have
been trained on an instrument but have not used it for a long period of
time may be asked to repeat their training.

### Laboratory and Personal Safety Equipment

The university and department have established general rules for use of
safety equipment when working in the laboratory. We have established our
own rules for best practices in the McKone lab, which in some cases
exceed the requirements of the department. In the (unlikely) event that
the rules outlined below come into conflict with those of the department
or university, the departmental or university rules take precedent.

Safety equipment, including fire extinguishers, showers, eye washes,
spill kits, and the like are located throughout our laboratory spaces
and have been labeled on the map shown below:

[Floorplan with safety equipment goes here]

It is imperative that each group member become familiar with the use of each of these pieces of equipment as well as their locations in the laboratory spaces. A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to find your way to a nearby shower, eye wash, or fire extinguisher within a few seconds even with your eyes closed!

With regard to personal protective equipment (PPE), McKone lab
researchers are expected to wear, at minimum, a fire-retardant lab coat,
safety glasses, and closed-toed shoes at all times when in the
laboratory space, without exception. Keep long hair tied back so that
it stays well away from the face, behind the shoulders, and inside the
lab coat. Similarly, cumbersome jewelry such as necklaces and large
rings should not be worn because they may come into contact with
hazardous substances or decrease dexterity. You are also
strongly recommended to wear long pants and chemically resistant shoes
(e.g. leather, rubber, or thick canvas) in the lab. Avoid wearing
fabrics with a high content of synthetics such as polyester or nylon, as
they can increase risk in emergencies such as fires or chemical
spills.

Disposable gloves (e.g., nitrile or latex) should be worn when actively working with chemicals, materials, or equipment
that may be considered hazardous. It is important to keep in mind that
even innocuous materials (e.g., deionized water bottles) and surfaces
(e.g., computer keyboards, drawer handles) kept in the lab are likely to have come in
contact with irritating or hazardous substances. Therefore you are encouraged to wear gloves at all
times when working in the lab space. Judicious hand-washing when exiting
the lab is also a must.

It is crucially important to minimize transfer of hazardous materials
and equipment from the lab space to public spaces. To this end,
*always* remove gloves before handling door knobs and
exiting the lab. If it is necessary to transport chemicals outside the
lab, the best procedure is to take off one glove for handling keys, door
knobs, elevator buttons, etc., and to keep one hand gloved for handling
chemical containers. Similarly, if you are using a physical laboratory
notebook that moves back and forth between the lab and public areas,
please make every effort to keep it as clean as possible.

Additional PPE may be required for safely operating certain pieces of
equipment or carrying out specific procedures. For example, thick
neoprene gloves are necessary for safely adding and removing glassware
from caustic or corrosive cleaning solutions such as base baths
(concentrated alkali in water and alcohol). These additional PPE
requirements should be visibly posted on or near the relevant equipment
and specified in operating procedure documentation.

Proper use of PPE is crucial for safe operation in the lab. However, no
amount of physical safeguards can fully protect a researcher from
inherently dangerous practices. New equipment and procedures always
warrant a careful review of best practices with regard to safety. If you
have any questions or concerns about safe practices in the lab, please
consult colleagues and/or Prof. McKone. Similarly, if you are concerned
that a colleague is behaving in an unsafe way, please report it to a
senior lab/staff member or Prof. McKone immediately!

One of the most common and insidious sources of unsafe behavior is
complacency that often results from repetition. Researchers are encouraged to take
consistent breaks from lab work, especially work that involves
repetitive tasks. Ideally you should be taking breaks of at least 10--15
minutes every 1--2 hours that you spend doing any single task, including
writing at your desk! For repetitive lab work, more consistent
mini-breaks of perhaps a minute or two to deliberately divert and then
re-establish your concentration will help avoid mistakes and mishaps.

Two other common dangerous laboratory practices are
tired and working alone. Under no circumstances are McKone lab members
to run experiments when they have had inadequate sleep or when they are
very ill. Keep in mind that medical research has suggested that going
more than 20 hours without sleep causes cognitive deficits comparable to
alcohol intoxication.[^1] Neither should anyone ever work with hazardous
materials or equipment when alone in the lab space. This is true
regardless of the ease of the procedure, the researcher’s competency,
the time of day, or the proximity of colleagues or emergency personnel.
If you find yourself in a situation where you are the only one planning
to carry out experiments in the lab space, at the very least make
arrangements for a colleague to be nearby and to check on your status at
regular intervals.

    *Int. J. Occ. Med. Env. Health*
    2010.](http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10001-010-0004-9)

### Consequences for Unsafe Behavior

We operate on a sliding scale of tolerance for safety policy violations or failures to follow proscribed operating procedures, depending on the severity of the circumstances.
For minor safety violations, you will be required to speak with the administrator in charge of the equipment or materials that were treated unsafely (or with Prof. McKone) to discuss proper procedures. Use of the lab or instrument may resume when the
administrator is satisfied that you will behave safely in the future.

For moderate violations or repeated minor violations of lab safety
rules, access to the laboratory and/or instrument will
be revoked. Use can resume only upon verbal or written authorization
from *both* a laboratory/instrument administrator and Prof. McKone.

Severe violations or repeated moderate violations of safety rules will result in an indefinite ban from use of the equipment,
apparatus, or lab space in question. This may prevent you
from completing current research efforts, in which case Prof.
McKone will likely counsel you to significantly revise your
research plan, or possibly to leave the laboratory.

##Interpersonal Behavior

### Comportment

We expect that every person who works in or with the McKone lab will
maintain a high degree of professional comportment and courtesy to one
another at all times. Examples of inappropriate behavior include the
following:

-   Racist, sexist, or bigoted speech or actions
-   Harassment, bullying, or violent conduct
-   Uncivil or threatening behavior toward others, including yelling, put-downs, or
    swearing
-   Purposeful interference or sabotage of a coworker’s efforts
-   Fabrication or manipulation of data
-   Deliberate misuse or damage of laboratory equipment or supplies

We operate with a *zero tolerance* policy toward the conduct noted
above, or similarly egregious behaviors. This means that no warnings
will be issued, and researchers will answer for any of the above with
consequences that are appropriate to the severity of their behavior. At
minimum, the researcher will be required to meet with Prof. McKone to
discuss and to provide verbal or written assurance that he/she
understands that his/her behavior was inappropriate, and that it will
not happen again.

More severe or repeated inappropriate behavior will result in a
temporary ban from the laboratory, and the researcher will only be
allowed to return with a written apology to any appropriate parties as
well as written assurance to the lab at large that the inappropriate
behavior will not continue. Very severe behavior will simply result in
immediate and indefinite expulsion from the lab. Researchers should also
be advised that illegal behaviors (e.g. sexual harassment, threats or acts of violence, use
of illegal drugs) or violations of university policies (e.g. misuse of lab resources,
academic misconduct) will be referred to the appropriate authorities.

It is possible that McKone lab researchers may, from time to time, have a
professional or personal dispute with a colleague. Causes for disputes
might include disagreements over proper use of lab space or equipment,
or conflicts regarding authorship of a manuscript. In general, it is
imperative that you make arrangements to discuss the dispute directly
with the other party or parties involved,
even though it is often difficult to do so. Informal or formal mediation
to address disputes can be arranged with a work colleague, Prof. McKone,
or another member of the faculty/staff as the mediator.

It is also possible that a circumstance might arise where a researcher
is in conflict with a senior colleague (e.g. a staff member or
professor), or that a conflict with a peer is severe or sensitive. In
these cases, you are strongly encouraged to seek out advice or
assistance from a professor, a senior staff member, or an administrator
whom you trust. For example, it would be appropriate to seek advice or
guidance from Prof. McKone, a thesis committee member, or another
faculty/staff mentor whose is not directly involved in the conflict. In
some circumstances, addressing the conflict with the department chair or
a designated departmental liaison with the appropriate authority would be best.

Pitt makes available various campus-wide resources for concerns or conflicts, including [the student affairs office](http://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/), [the office of human resources](http://www.hr.pitt.edu/about-hr), and [the campus safety office](http://www.safety.pitt.edu/). Please make yourself familiar with these resources and do not hesitate to use them as needed.

##Work Schedule

### Hours

Research success comes with sustained, productive time spent in and
around the laboratory. As a general rule, full-time researchers should
expect to spend around 45 active hours per week on
their lab work. In this context, “active hours" means time spent
specifically working on laboratory tasks, including experimental work,
reading the literature, writing papers/reports, discussing work in
formal/informal meetings, and presenting results. You are free to manage
and plan your own hours, provided that you are working safely and
making adequate progress.

In academia, undue emphasis is often placed on the number of hours spent at work.
In reality, researchers are highly variable in terms of what proportion of their time spent at the lab is productive.
This means that the average amount of time spent in and around the lab space could vary considerably from person to person, or even for the same person at various stages of her/his research career.
That said, if you are consistently feeling obligated to spend 60 hours per week or more at Pitt in order to meet expectations, or if you are struggling to fill your time with productive work, please consider discussing these circumstances with a senior colleague or Prof. McKone.

### Holidays and Vacation

Lab members are encouraged to take up to 30 days or 6 weeks (based on a
5-day work week) of holiday and vacation time on an annual basis. This
is the same amount of vacation that is offered to Pitt faculty and
academic staff. Specific vacation schedules are at the discretion of
each researcher. Prof. McKone tends to follow the holiday/vacation schedule noted below,
which coincides with days in which Pitt University offices are closed.

| **Holiday**                | **No. of Days** | **Dates (in 2016)**   |
|:---------------------------|:----------------|:----------------------|
| New Year’s Day             | 1               | January 1             |
| Martin Luther King Jr. Day | 1               | January 18            |
| Spring Holiday             | 1               | March 11              |
| Memorial Day               | 1               | May 30                |
| Independence Day           | 1               | July 4                |
| Labor Day                  | 1               | August 5              |
| Halloween                  | 1               | October 31            |
| Thanksgiving               | 2               | November 24–25        |
| Winter Holidays            | 6               | December 23 and 26–30 |
| Additional vacation        | 15              | ---                   |
| Total                      | 30              | ---                   |

Any other way you wish to structure your vacation time is acceptable. Keep in
mind that most lab members and support staff will take certain holidays
off (e.g. July 4 and Dec 24 to Jan 1), and this may prevent you from
working productively and safely in the lab during those times.

Researchers should notify Prof. McKone and any collaborators of their
planned absence before they depart, ideally at least 3 weeks ahead. For
extended absences of more than a few days, lab space must be cleaned and
cleared of active experiments before departure. Additional days off are
negotiable on an as-needed basis. In most cases, researchers requesting
additional time off will be asked to develop of a plan for ensuring that
their research will stay on track.

### Sick days

Lab members who are ill, or who need to care for an ill family member,
are strongly encouraged to stay home from work. Coming to work sick
leads to low productivity, longer recovery time, and poor outcomes; it
can also lead to the spread of illnesses throughout the group. Eight
sick days per year are allowed for each lab member, no questions asked.
Please notify Prof. McKone if you will miss work due to an illness. For
an extended illness, additional sick days can be negotiated on an
as-needed basis.

### Emergency and Family Leave

Some circumstances demand that a lab member will be absent for an
extended or indeterminate amount of time from the laboratory. Examples
include:

-   Family or personal emergency
-   Child birth and/or infant care
-   Death of a family member or friend

Researchers are *always* permitted to take time off for these types of
circumstances. If the absence is foreseeable, please inform Prof. McKone
when and how long you expect to be away. If the absence is due to an
emergency, please contact Prof. McKone to notify the lab of your absence
and expected return as soon as you can. Specific details regarding
graduation requirements, stipend payments, TA responsibilities, etc.
during extended leave depends on the lab member’s student/employment
status, current funding sources, and research progress. Therefore these
issues will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

### Meetings

Research meetings are important to facilitate the exchange of ideas, to
troubleshoot research challenges, and for researchers to develop
skills in oral presentation. However, excessive meetings can also be
tedious and rapidly erode time that can be more productively spent
elsewhere. Therefore we try to keep meetings as brief and effective as
possible.

Each week we have one meeting with all group members. Each group meeting begins with one researcher giving a short (aim for 30 minutes) presentation and discussion on a topic of his/her choice. Common topics include interesting publications, news items, or tips and tricks for improving lab work. T
he second portion of group meeting is a longer (aim for 45 minutes) presentation by a different group member on his/her recent research.
For this presentation, you are strongly encouraged to discuss experiments in progress, challenges, and perplexing questions as well as successes and new insights.
Responsibility for each of these presentations will rotate through the lab.
We will try to ensure that the whole meeting does not last longer than 90 minutes.

Researchers should also plan for regular individual and small-group meetings with Prof. McKone. Ideally, Prof. McKone would like to average at least 20 minutes per week of face-to-face time with each student (i.e. not including our weekly meetings).
These meetings can be scheduled as necessary.
Topics covered in these meetings might include addressing challenges in the lab, sharing ideas for new projects, planning for future opportunities, preparing manuscripts, etc.

#Guides for Researchers

This section of the handbook includes a brief note from Professor McKone
regarding his approach to research mentorship.
That is followed by short
guides for each type of researcher that works in the McKone lab---graduate
students, undergraduates, postdoctoral researchers, and visiting
scientists.
These guides spell out in greater detail expectations for
your work as well as some suggestions for achieving success.

##A note from Prof. McKone

Greetings and thanks again for your interest and/or involvement in our research group.
I am providing here a short note that I hope will provide some insight
regarding my personal philosophy and approach to professorship.

My primary role as a professor is to guide my group members and other Pitt students toward successful outcomes.
Those outcomes are defined by the requirements of the university and by the goals of the students/researchers themselves.
For example, a successful graduate student will gain a high level of expertise in one or more topics associated with his/her thesis research through dedicated work in the classroom, the laboratory, and the broader community.
Ideally he/she will leave with an excellent record of publication and service and demonstrable skills that will make for a smooth transition to the next vocational opportunity.

A large proportion of my intellectual and physical energy goes into
mentoring graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduates in my lab.
As a mentor, I try to emphasize autonomy, respect, and accountability for each member
of the group.
Although I often have my own ideas and thoughts as to the
most exciting and tractable experiments to run, I strongly encourage
everyone to develop and pursue her/his own research ideas
and to freely exchange ideas both inside and outside our group.

My responsibilities also encompass teaching and service roles.
Along with most of the other professors in the CPE department at Pitt, I teach
one course per semester on average at the graduate or undergraduate
level.
I place a high priority on teaching, and I do my best to take
adequate time to prepare for lectures and office hours and to write
homework problems and exams.
My service work includes committee and
administrative functions for the CPE department, and I provide broader
service to the engineering community, e.g., by organizing and
chairing sessions at the annual AICHE meeting.
I strongly encourage all graduate students and postdocs to become involved in at least one
teaching and service opportunity during their tenure at Pitt, regardless of your vocational goals.

Another important area of service is community outreach.
During my graduate and postdoctoral years, I spent a
significant amount of time working with secondary school and
undergraduate students on activities and research projects intended to
increase their efficacy toward the STEM disciplines.
I continue to pursue interesting outreach opportunities as a professor, and I hope
that members of my group will involve themselves in outreach efforts as
well.
It is extremely rewarding!

Practically, I spend my time at Pitt (in rough order of most to least time) writing, talking, reading, and thinking.
Being an assistant professor means that I spend a lot of time writing grant proposals and preparing lectures.
I also spend lots of time talking with colleagues and lab members in meetings, one-on-one discussions, and over the phone.
I travel regularly to give seminars at conferences and at other universities, in order to disseminate our work and to promote our lab and Pitt research as a whole.
I read reports, theses, manuscript drafts, and the published literature to keep up with the latest work of interest to our group.
Finally, I find it important to set aside regular time to brainstorm and develop ideas alone and in collaboration with my students and colleagues.
Conspicuously absent from this list is time spent running experiments!
I am available to help develop and teach laboratory procedures, and I expect to spend some time in lab collecting preliminary data, but for the most part I leave lab work to students and postdocs.

I place a high priority on maintaining a balanced lifestyle.
I try not to overwork myself and to make healthy life choices.
This means, for example, trying to get adequate sleep each night, spending time with my family,
exercising regularly, and eating well.
My ideal work schedule is to spend no more than 50 hours per week in and around the lab. I sometimes
do additional work from home, but I try to completely disconnect for one
full day per week (usually Saturdays).
I also stay active with several hobbies unrelated to my work at Pitt, which include cooking, watching movies, reading, and playing and listening to music.
I encourage all members of my research group to make an effort to maintain a balanced
lifestyle.
Your work and overall happiness will benefit as a result.

I will conclude with some general advice on how we can work fruitfully
together.
First, keep in mind that I am splitting my time and attention
between multiple projects and responsibilities inside and outside of our
lab.
This means that the best approach you can take is to consistently
try “manage up” by telling me how I can be most helpful to you.
More broadly, be active and direct in describing what you need from me and from your peers.
If you are comfortable, I also value feedback on whether or not you find my input and advice helpful.
In the same way, I will try to give clear encouragement and constructive criticism in appropriate and balanced measures.
Finally, above all I recommend that you trust your own good sense.
All likelihood is that you know more than anyone else about your
own work, and so you are in the best position to make wise choices on
how to proceed.

# Graduate Student Guide

As a graduate student, your primary goal is to accumulate knowledge,
experience, and research accomplishments that collectively merit
awarding of a graduate degree (master’s and/or PhD).
You will deepen your knowledge through coursework, advance the field of chemical
engineering through research, and contribute to the missions of the CPE
department through teaching and service.

The specific requirements for graduate studies in CPE at Pitt are enumerated in two bulletins: the [SSOE graduate bulletin][SSOEbull] and the [chemical and petroleum engineering graduate bulletin][CPEbull].
To be awarded a graduate degree, students will need to complete those requirements and demonstrate substantial progress in original research as reflected in a thesis/dissertation.
For a master’s degree, progress on one primary project is sufficient, whereas for a PhD the dissertation should discuss several research accomplishments.
Ideally a master’s student will complete his/her degree in 1–2 years and publish at least one paper as a the leading author; ideally PhD students will finish in 5 years and publish three or more papers as the leading authors.
These publication guidelines, however, are not absolute requirements.
Prof. McKone places a high priority on graduating PhDs within 5 years, and he is very reluctant to keep anyone on for more than 6, regardless of his/her progress toward completion of the degree.

[SSOEbull]: http://www.bulletins.pitt.edu/graduate/engineering.htm
[CPEbull]: http://www.bulletins.pitt.edu/graduate/engchem.htm

For the sake of convenience, it makes sense to classify master’s and PhD students in their first year or two as *junior graduate students*, and those who have passed their exams and are in their third year or beyond as *senior graduate students*.

The first two years comprise a transition from primarily coursework, which emphasizes well-established principles, toward original research, which emphasizes new ideas.
Junior graduate students are encouraged to concentrate on coursework and teaching responsibilities, especially in the first semester or two.
In terms of research, try to target one well-defined research project initially.
Writing a master’s thesis and/or passing the PhD qualifying exam will require that you can demonstrate a high level of proficiency in the broad principles of chemical engineering and that you have made progress toward original insights in the laboratory.

Upon passing the qualifying exam, senior graduate students focus
more directly on making progress in the lab.
A good way to structure your lab work is to maintain one primary project at all times and to
maintain one or more additional “side" projects.
Primary projects are likely to yield lead-author publications, and they will be the
main focus of your dissertation.
A side project might be a collaboration with a colleague at Pitt or elsewhere, where you are providing some specific expertise or insight, or it might be an original research idea
that needs some promising preliminary results before meriting more detailed attention.
These efforts will lead to co-authorship on publications, or they may become primary projects later.

Along with lab work, graduate students have several other responsibilities.
Each student will likely be placed in charge of one or
more instruments or apparatus in the lab, which carries the
responsibilities of maintenance and training.
Senior students should also consider mentoring undergraduates or junior lab members.
Graduate students should also be keeping up with the published literature in
their area of study, and they should attend research seminars on campus regularly.

It is important for graduate students to develop skills in presenting
their work to technical and non-technical audiences.
Thus, in addition to regular internal group meeting presentations, each student should try to
give one or two public research presentations per year, beginning in the
second year.
There are many opportunities to present research publicly on the Pitt campus or elsewhere in the immediate vicinity (e.g., at local conferences or one of the other universities in Pittsburgh) as part of a poster session or seminar series.
Prof. McKone will also try to provide opportunities for each graduate student
to attend one or more national conferences (e.g. AICHE, ACS, MRS, Gordon
Conference, etc.) during their Pitt tenure.
Expenses for trips to conferences will be covered through laboratory funds or travel-specific
grants/fellowships, but keep in mind that local meetings are the easiest to fund.

Graduate students are also asked to take significant responsibility for writing manuscripts and informal reports.
Prof. McKone will work with junior graduate students as closely as needed to draft their first manuscripts, whereas senior graduate students may reach a level of fluency that they will only need editorial input and final approval from Prof. McKone prior to submission.
From time to time, Prof. McKone will also ask for brief research reports or graphical data in order to prepare external presentations and progress reports.
Grad students need not be directly involved in writing research proposals, but those who are interested in learning more about that process are welcome to contribute upon request.

Here are a handful of additional tips for grad students:

-   As Prof. McKone’s graduate thesis advisor Harry Gray used to say,
    “Don’t peak too soon!" This means don’t get down on
    yourself for not having earth-shattering results right away in your
    graduate career. Most students don’t really hit their stride until
    they are approaching graduation.

-   Begin planning for the qualifying and thesis examinations well ahead
    of time---4 months or more for quals and perhaps 9 months or more for
    the thesis exam. These events are inevitable sources of stress, but
    starting to think about them very early allows you to approach them
    at a measured pace.

-   Keep your piles small: don’t let un-analyzed data,
    unfinished manuscripts, ungraded homework, etc. build up. Many people
    find that the thing they least like to do tends to be the very thing
    that accumulates, and then it comes to dominate their existence.
    Completing each of your major tasks roughly in the order that they
    arrive is a good way to keep this from happening.

-   Read a lot of papers! It is amazing how often a few hours spent
    reading the published literature can save days of effort in the lab.
    Set aside some regular time every week (a few hours at least) to
    review the current literature. Also, before starting a new project,
    it is advisable to spend as much as several days familiarizing
    yourself with the current and historical literature on the topic.

-   Don’t be afraid to take time just to think carefully about your
    research projects. Many grad students make the mistake of trying to
    run as many experiments as is humanly possible, and in doing so they
    fail to plan any single experiment with adequate care. A useful
    rule of thumb is that you should learn something useful from every
    single experiment you run.

-   Maintain multiple lines of inquiry in the lab. It really stinks when
    your main line of research gets "stuck" due to some unforeseen
    challenge or, even worse, some delay that is out of your
    control (e.g. instrument is down). If you follow the model of having
    one main project and several minor projects, it becomes easier to
    fill in those gaps with work that is productive and hopefully more
    satisfying than just waiting to get "un-stuck."

-   Be a whole person. Although this was already mentioned in terms of
    maintaining a balanced lifestyle, it bears repeating. Nothing leads
    to burnout faster or more consistently than acting like an automaton
    whose single purpose is to churn out lab work and nothing else.
    Cultivate your interests in areas other than your own research,
    scientific or otherwise. Grad students are allowed to be real
    people!

-   Try as best you can to become intellectually and materially
    independent from your peers and from your advisor. The more you can
    accomplish without regular input or instructions from others, the
    more successful you are likely to be in grad school and beyond.

-   Although it’s important to be intellectually independent, try also
    to keep in close touch with members of other labs. Engage them in
    conversation about your work and theirs. It is easy for university
    research labs to become "silos" with relatively little
    external interaction. This is, for one thing, socially awkward, and
    for another it can lead to very narrow and uncreative thinking. So
    try to keep the conversation going with your community of peers at
    Pitt from your first year right through graduation.

# Undergraduate Guide

We are always excited to involve undergraduate students in research.
Whether working over the summer or during the school year, undergrads
can have a significant impact on our collective efforts, and they will
also reap positive benefits for their own intellectual development and career prospects. In
general, undergraduate students should keep in mind three goals. First,
lab work allows you to diversify and enhance your undergraduate
education with hands-on experience. Second, lab work can inform
decisions about future education and career objectives. Third,
successful lab work can greatly increase your credibility and
competitiveness for later educational and career opportunities,
especially in STEM-related areas.

In general, undergrads will work in close collaboration with one or more
graduate or postdoc mentors. These mentorship relationships should be
established by mutual interest and explicit agreement to work together.
That is, Prof. McKone will not “assign" undergraduates to work
with particular grad students or postdocs; rather he will direct
interested students toward lab members who might make a good match
with an undergraduate mentee. Undergrad students who are interested in
our group are encouraged to contact Prof. McKone or existing group
members directly to get this mentorship conversation started.

Undergraduate researchers and their mentors should invest significant
time up front to create a well-defined research plan. That plan should
focus on exposing you to a variety of research tools and
methods, and it should clearly delineate research problems and
hypotheses to justify and motivate the work. It is important to avoid
scenarios where an undergrad researcher simply functions as an spare
pair of hands assisting his/her mentor’s work. In most cases it is best
to create a brief proposal or outline of the planned research activities
to make sure you, your mentor, and Prof. McKone are all
on the same page.

Regarding specific research projects, two broad categories are natural
fits for undergrads. The first is where the undergrad researcher takes
on a brand new challenge that the group has not attempted previously.
This “high-risk, high-reward" research is very exciting, but it
might be inadvisable for grad students or postdocs since it is less
likely to lead to results that can be published or included in a thesis.
This type of project might be perfect for an undergrad who is ambitious
and not easily discouraged by unsuccessful or unanticipated outcomes.
The second type of project is where the undergrad pursues original work
that parallels or expands on that of her/his mentor. For example, if the
mentor has been synthesizing and characterizing catalyst materials
comprised of elements A and B, the undergraduate mentee might work on
catalysts containing elements A and C. Bear in mind that there should
always be a coherent rationale for the departure from the mentor’s work,
and you should be intellectually and materially responsible
for advancing your own work in spite of any overlap with that of your mentor.

Since undergraduates enter the lab with a modest amount of previous
experience, there are a few additional rules that you are asked to
follow. The first rule is that *coursework always comes first*. We
certainly hope that working in our lab will enhance your education, but
it should be seen as an extra-curricular or co-curricular activity. Thus
it should not directly interfere with your course schedule and
commitments. Under no circumstances should an undergraduate lab member
forsake course responsibilities (e.g. class attendance,
homework) in favor of working in the lab. Neither is lab work a valid
excuse for not completing course work. If you are struggling to balance
course responsibilities with lab work, please consult with your mentor
and/or Prof. McKone to consider modifying your research focus as needed
to better accommodate your availability.

Undergraduates are also asked to obey a more stringent rule regarding
supervision: never work in the lab space without at least one
grad student or postdoc also present. The supervising lab member need
not be your mentor, nor do they need to explicitly monitor your work,
but he/she should be available to help in case you have questions or in the unlikely event of an emergency.
This rule means that in some cases undergrads will need to coordinate working hours
carefully with other lab members, especially during the school year.
Course schedules may dictate that the most convenient time for an
undergrad to work might be at odd hours (e.g. after dinner or on
weekends). Although it is perfectly fine to work during those times, it
is not safe to assume that a grad student or postdoc will always be
available to supervise.

Undergraduates who are actively working in the McKone group are
considered “full" lab members, in the sense that they will be provided
office space and access to the lab just as with any other researcher to the extent that the department allows.
In return, you are required to take full part in lab responsibilities,
including cleaning and upkeep of lab and office spaces. You should make arrangements to attend weekly laboratory meetings.
You will also be included in the rotation for giving research presentations.
In most cases, however, multiple undergraduates will be scheduled for one
meeting to allow for shorter talks.
If our meetings or other group activities conflict with school or extracurricular responsibilities,
accommodations can be made in consultation with Prof. McKone.

A few other tips and suggestions for undergraduates are worth mentioning:

-   Seek out conversations and advice from more than one group member.
    Although you will have one or perhaps two formal mentors, many group
    members might have useful insights regarding your research project
    or helpful advice regarding coursework or future career options.

-   Plan your time in lab carefully. Summer research periods are short
    (usually 8–10 weeks), and so it is important to avoid hastily
    devised forays in directions that end up being unproductive for your
    project or your learning. Research during the school year is even
    harder, as undergrads usually cannot spend more than a few hours in
    the lab at a time. The most important thing to remember in this
    context is to always plan ahead and set realistic goals about what
    you can accomplish in the time you have available.

-   Prioritize intellectual independence in
    your research. This means developing your own working knowledge of
    every aspect of your project so that you don’t rely on your mentor
    for instructions on what to do next or what results to expect. In
    this context, excellent undergraduate researchers can become so
    independent that they effectively function as junior grad students. This is a
    desirable outcome, but keep in mind that it usually takes multiple
    summers and semesters of diligent work to reach that point.

-   Don’t be afraid to propose new experiments. Grad students,
    postdocs, and professors do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Once
    you gain some experience in a lab setting, all likelihood is that
    you will have interesting ideas of your own that might be
    worth pursuing. Talk to your mentor about those ideas and develop a
    plan to push the project in directions that you find exciting.

-   If you are dissatisfied or not enjoying your work, let someone know.
    Sometimes a research project just turns out to be a “dud," or maybe
    it isn’t right for your temperament. If that is the case, it is
    usually very easy to find something different to do. It is possible
    that you will simply decide that our research methods and approaches aren’t right
    for you, in which case Prof. McKone would be happy to work with you
    to consider opportunities in other labs.

# Postdoctoral Researcher Guide

Postdocs are in a unique position in a laboratory since their tenure is generally shorter than that of PhD students, but they are also more experienced and have fewer requirements compared to grad students.
Postdocs also have the most diverse set of plausible goals: some might seek specific research experience for a well-defined employment opportunity; others might be looking to expand their skill set more generally so as to improve future job prospects; others might be interested in taking on administrative or mentorship roles in preparation for future work in academics, government, or industry.
Any of these goals is excellent, but it is very important that you communicate your intentions clearly to Prof. McKone beginning during the interview process and continuing well after beginning work in the lab.

Postdocs will likely spend between one and three years in the McKone
lab. Expectations regarding research effort and output are similar to
those of senior graduate students. A good rule of thumb is to focus on
at least one primary project and one or more secondary project or
collaboration at all times. Postdocs are particularly encouraged to seek
out collaborations with other research groups and to integrate their
previous research experience with our own so as to expand the group’s
expertise. Also as with graduate students, postdocs should be broadly
responsible for drafting research reports and manuscripts.

Postdocs are strongly encouraged to apply for external research funding
through grants and fellowships. Many of these require independent
reports to be submitted, and these provide good practice for future work in
the academic, government, or industrial sectors. Postdocs should also
make an effort to integrate into the research community at Pitt by
attending seminars and presenting their research. As with graduate
students, Prof. McKone will work to facilitate travel to at least one
external conference annually.

Most of the time, postdocs are looking to transition from their current
position toward long-term employment elsewhere. Therefore it is very
important to begin pursuing potential job opportunities at least 6
months to a year before your intended departure. Over the last several
years the job market in the chemical sciences has been tightening, and
so finding a job often requires a great deal of effort. It is perfectly
acceptable to consider the job search as part of your work role as a
postdoc. This means that, e.g., traveling for job interviews and working
on applications can be considered as productive work time, even at the
expense of short-term progress on your research projects. Prof. McKone
will put forward as much effort as he can to help you make connections
to further your career, whether that means writing recommendation
letters, sending you to conferences for networking purposes, or helping
to facilitate personal connections.

Here are some additional tips and suggestions for postdocs:

-   Seek out regular interactions with more than one research mentor.
    For one reason, cross-pollinating ideas between research groups is
    fun and rewarding. For another, consider that most employers require
    at least three reference letters for applicants. Usually this means
    your thesis advisor, your postdoc advisor, and at least one “wild
    card“ letter writer. The most compelling reference letters usually
    come from mentors who know you well and are familiar with your most
    recent accomplishments. That said, be careful about becoming
    administratively involved in more than one research group, as being
    an ”official" member of more than one group only works well
    if you and both primary investigators are in close agreement about
    your responsibilities to each.

-   It is a good idea to keep your CV current and to keep on hand a few business cards with your contact information. You never know when a potential employment opportunity will arise. Nowadays it is also worthwhile to purchase and maintain a simple website that compiles your professional information and provides a way for others to contact you electronically. That way, even if a potential employer loses your business card, she/he can find you using a simple internet search. Social media can also be helpful in this context, but bear in mind that mixing personal and professional interactions on social media can be off-putting for potential employers.  

-   Moderate your self-expectations in the first few months of
    the postdoc. The transition from one institution to another is
    always jarring, and it usually takes at least 6 months before a
    postdoc can attain anywhere near the level of productivity that
    she/he sustained at the peak of graduate school. So take it easy
    initially and don’t get down on yourself.

-   Plan the content and execution of your research projects carefully.
    Since postdocs work on a relatively short time frame, good planning
    and careful work are especially important. Be sure to talk to
    coworkers and Prof. McKone regularly within your first several
    months of postdoctoral work to ensure that your research
    plans are likely to lead to productive outcomes.

-   Vigorously pursue external research funding. Postdoctoral fellowship
    and grant programs are nowadays few and far between, but external
    funding significantly increases your flexibility as a postdoc. They
    also greatly improve your credibility as an independent thinker,
    which most employers find very important. Not to mention the pay is
    almost always better!

-   Connect with other postdocs in your field, both locally and nationally. Many of them will remain your colleagues for years to come, and there is no better time to begin building relationships. Keeping in touch with other postdocs can also be helpful in the interest of “comparing notes" about employment opportunities and current trends in research. Consider as a relevant example that Prof. McKone was first made aware of the tenure-track opening at Pitt through a personal connection with Prof. Keith, and not through a formal job posting!

-   Actively pursue multiple career options. Many postdocs are targeting a
    specific career outcome, but
    personal circumstances and external factors can change those plans
    in a hurry! Think of it this way: wise career choices are only made
    with full awareness of all of the available possibilities. So even
    if your goal is, e.g., a position at a national lab, consider
    pursuing interviews in industrial labs as well in the interest of
    keeping your options open and validating your final decision with
    knowledge rather than speculation about the alternatives.

##Visiting Researcher Guide

From time to time, we welcome research visitors from other institutions to work in our lab. These visitors might range in expertise and seniority from high school students to professors. Visiting grad students and postdocs should consider themselves to be McKone group grad students and postdocs for the time that they are Pitt, with all of the attendant rules and recommendations. Visiting senior scientists are simply asked to follow the rules and recommendations for the McKone group that best apply to them. Minors who visit or work in our lab will need to be managed by an appropriate mentor or guardian, whose role will be outlined on an individual basis.

The most important thing for all visitors to keep in mind is that exceptions will not be made to any of the lab rules and operating procedures for visitors, regardless of their level of experience or seniority. We acknowledge that your visit might be brief or highly informal, or your home research group or institution might have rules or procedures that are different from ours. We are often happy to discuss alternative experimental or administrative approaches in the interest of improving our lab. Nevertheless, we expect visitors to adhere to the rules regarding safety, interpersonal behavior, etc. that are spelled out in this lab handbook, and to accept the consequences for violations.
