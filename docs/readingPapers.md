# Tips for finding and reading publications

This guide discusses a general approach for finding and reading scientific publications. The strategy involves a series of _multiple passes_, where each consecutive pass is intended to help you extract additional information or insight from the paper. While it seems that the approach might take more time than trying to read a paper very carefully one time through, the net result is much better understanding relative to the total amount time required. Note that this guide was written with experimental publications in physical sciences and engineering in mind, but similar approaches can be taken with all manner of technical writing. The approach is loosely based on a reading technique popularized by [Evelyn Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Wood_(teacher)).

## Find papers to read

Broadly speaking, there are three routes you can pursue to find papers worth reading:

1. Browse a current journal issue. This can be done using a physical copy of the journal or online. It is arguably the least efficient way to search for papers, but many journals are organized according to topic, so each issue of a journal whose topic matches your interest is likely to have at least one paper that you might find interesting.
2. Do a topical search online. A number of online resources are available for searching the published literature by title, topic, author, etc. Two good options are [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) and [Web of Science](http://www.webofscience.com).
3. Use references from an existing publication. Essentially all journals require extensive references to appear in their published articles to support discussion or claims regarding previous work in the field. The associated citations can be used to help you find useful publications that are closely related to whatever you are currently reading.

Before diving in to any particular article, accumulate a list of papers you might like to read. It is a good idea to try to find more papers than you think you need and then to choose a subset to read carefully. If you are hoping to accumulate extensive knowledge, you should also be willing to seek out hard-to-find papers that are decades old or that appear in obscure journals.

## First pass: browse abstracts and down-select

The best way to choose which papers to read is to start with the abstracts. Read the abstract text and use it to answer the following questions:

* What is the main topic of the paper?
* Is it interesting to me?
* Is the presentation clear?

Based on the answers to those questions, make a decision as to whether you want to read the paper in greater detail or move on to the next one. Even if you donâ€™t read it, consider importing the reference into your favorite reference manager (examples include Endnote, JabRef, Mendeley, Zotero, Papers, and many others).

## Second pass: main ideas

In the next pass, you should focus on capturing the main ideas of the paper. Read the introduction and conclusion sections first. Then browse through the section headings and the topic sentences in each paragraph. Finally, glance through any figures, graphics, and tables to get a sense for the data that are being presented. These parts alone should contain sufficient detail to help you answer the following questions:

* What is the context and purpose of the paper?
* What hypotheses (if any) do the authors advance?
* What is the main point or argument, and how does it relate to the hypotheses?
* What are the main conclusions?

From this information, you should now be able to describe to another person what the paper was about in general terms. You can also begin to formulate a more detailed opinion about the paper. For example, you may feel that the conclusions are obvious and the paper is boring, or that the conclusions are far-fetched and so you are skeptical. These opinions are very useful to motivate and inform subsequent passes. Alternatively, you may feel that you understand everything you need about this paper and can choose to move on to another one.

## Third pass: read for comprehension

In this pass, you will begin to understand the specifics of data and discussion. Focus on the middle part of the paper, which usually contains experimental details, results, and discussion. Sometimes each of these parts are contained in separate sections, and other times they are combined in various permutations. Focus now especially on any figures, graphics, and tables, as these are the main sources of quantitative information. The discussion that accompanies the data provides a description of the authors' observations and their interpretation of the results. As you begin to look in detail at the data and discussion, try to answer the following questions for each figure, graphic, or table:

* What is the specific information being presented?
* What methods/techniques were used to collect the data?
* What are the key trends apparent from the data presentation?
* How do these trends support (or not support) the authors' interpretation and conclusions?

Once you have a good grasp of the data presented in the paper, and how those data relate to the arguments being presented, you will likely be able to discuss the paper in moderate detail, as if you had seen it presented by the authors in person. By this point, you will also probably naturally form an opinion as to whether or not you think the research methods, analysis, and interpretation are credible. It is important to recognize that very few publications have no discernable weak points, so it is absolutely reasonable to be broadly skeptical of the research that you read.

## Fourth pass: deep dive

A final pass in reading a publication involves focusing on the details and making more specific critical judgements. Read very carefully small sections of the paper at a time, with the goal of following the authors' discussion and logic completely. Consider trying to reproduce the analysis on your own by deriving equations or looking up the cited references. For experimental work, you might even consider trying to reproduce the results in your own lab. Try to address the following questions:

* Are the data entirely consistent with the authors' conclusions?
* Are there alternative explanations that would fit the data equally well?
* Were the experiments properly chosen to address the hypothesis, or are there better experiments that could be run?
* Were the experiments executed properly, or is there evidence from the data or control experiments that there was some experimental error?
* Do these results agree with analogous work published elsewhere?
* If the results disagree with other work, is there an explanation that can resolve the conflict, or is one likely to be wrong?

With this pass you will develop a deep understanding of the paper, and you will likely be able to present and discuss the work almost as if you did it yourself. You may also identify important problems or deficiencies in the data collection or analysis, which are good to be aware of.  While this level of understanding is unnecessary for most papers, it is a good idea to get to this point for foundational work related to your research project.
