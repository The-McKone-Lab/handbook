# Interpersonal Behavior

We expect that every person who works in or with the McKone lab will
maintain a high degree of professional comportment and courtesy to one
another at all times. Examples of inappropriate behavior include the
following:

-   Racist, sexist, or bigoted speech or actions
-   Harassment, bullying, or violent conduct
-   Uncivil or threatening behavior toward others, including yelling, put-downs, or egregious instances of cursing
-   Purposeful interference or sabotage of a coworkerâ€™s efforts
-   Fabrication or manipulation of data
-   Deliberate misuse or damage of laboratory equipment or supplies

We operate with a *zero tolerance* policy toward the conduct noted
above, or similarly egregious behaviors. This means that no warnings
will be issued, and researchers will answer for any of the above with
consequences that are appropriate to the severity of their behavior. At
minimum, the researcher will be required to meet with Prof. McKone to
discuss and to provide verbal or written assurance that he/she
understands that his/her behavior was inappropriate, and that it will
not happen again.

More severe or repeated inappropriate behavior will result in a
temporary ban from the laboratory, and the researcher will only be
allowed to return with a written apology to any appropriate parties as
well as written assurance to the lab at large that the inappropriate
behavior will not continue. Very severe behavior will simply result in
immediate and indefinite expulsion from the lab. Researchers should also
be advised that illegal behaviors (e.g. sexual harassment, threats or acts of violence, use
of illegal drugs) or violations of university policies (e.g. misuse of lab resources,
academic misconduct) will be referred to the appropriate authorities.

It is possible that McKone lab researchers may, from time to time, have a
professional or personal dispute with a colleague. Causes for disputes
might include disagreements over proper use of lab space or equipment,
or conflicts regarding authorship of a manuscript. In general, it is
imperative that you make arrangements to discuss the dispute directly
with the other party or parties involved,
even though it is often difficult to do so. Informal or formal mediation
to address disputes can be arranged with a work colleague, Prof. McKone,
or another member of the faculty/staff as the mediator.

It is also possible that a circumstance might arise where a researcher
is in conflict with a senior colleague (e.g. a staff member or
professor), or that a conflict with a peer is severe or sensitive. In
these cases, you are strongly encouraged to seek out advice or
assistance from a professor, a senior staff member, or an administrator
whom you trust. For example, it would be appropriate to seek advice or
guidance from Prof. McKone, a thesis committee member, or another
faculty/staff mentor whose is not directly involved in the conflict. In
some circumstances, addressing the conflict with the department chair or
a designated departmental liaison with the appropriate authority would be best.

Pitt makes available various campus-wide resources for concerns or conflicts, including [the student affairs office](http://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/), [the office of human resources](http://www.hr.pitt.edu/about-hr), and [the campus safety office](http://www.safety.pitt.edu/). Please make yourself familiar with these resources and do not hesitate to use them as needed.
