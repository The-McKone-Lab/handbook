## Working Hours 

Research success comes with sustained, productive time spent in and around the laboratory. As a general rule, full-time researchers should expect to spend 40 active hours or more per week on their lab work. In this context, “active hours” means time spent specifically working on laboratory tasks like running experiments, reading the literature, writing papers/reports, discussing work in formal/informal meetings, and presenting results. Additional recommendations and discussion about lab hours can be found in the attached appendix. You are free to manage and plan your own hours, provided that you are working safely and making adequate progress. 

In academia, undue emphasis is often placed on the number of hours spent at work. In reality, researchers are highly variable in terms of what proportion of their time spent at the lab is productive. This means the average amount of time spent in and around the lab space could vary considerably between two people making overall progress at roughly the same rate; one person may even spend markedly different amounts of time in and around the lab at various stages of their research career. That said, if you are consistently feeling obligated to spend many more hours on campus than you want just to meet expectations, or if you are struggling to fill a week's worth of ~8 hour days with productive work, please consider discussing these circumstances with a senior colleague or with James. 

## Holidays and Vacation 

Our lab intentionally maintains no strict policy regarding time off for holidays and vacation. However, lab members are encouraged to take 30 days or 6 weeks (based on a 5-day work week) of holiday and vacation time on an annual basis. This is about the same amount of vacation that is offered to Pitt faculty and many professional engineers (particularly in Western Europe, where people seem to have a healthier work/life balance!). Specific vacation schedules are at the discretion of each researcher. James tends to follow a holiday/vacation schedule that roughly coincides with days in which Pitt University offices are closed, plus an additional week or two of personal/family vacation time per year.

Any way you wish to structure your vacation time is acceptable. Keep in mind that most lab members and support staff will take certain holidays off (e.g. July 4 and Dec 24 to Jan 1), and this may prevent you from working productively and safely in the lab during those times. You should notify James and any collaborators of your planned absence before you depart, ideally at least 3 weeks in advance. For extended absences of more than a few days, lab space must be cleaned and cleared of active experiments before departure. 

## Sick days 

Lab members who are ill, or who need to care for an ill family member, are strongly encouraged to stay home from work. Coming to work sick leads to low productivity, longer recovery time, and poor outcomes; it can also lead to the spread of illnesses throughout the group. Eight sick days per year are allowed for each lab member, no questions asked. Additional sick days can be provided as needed, usually along with some discussion about what can be done to remain on track to complete project tasks. 

Emergency and Family Leave 
Some circumstances demand that a lab member will be absent for an extended or indeterminate amount of time from the laboratory. Examples include: 

* Family or personal emergency
* Child birth and/or infant care
* Death of a family member or friend 

Researchers are always permitted to take time off for these types of circumstances. If the absence is foreseeable, please let James know when and how long you expect to be away. If the absence is due to an emergency, please contact James to notify the lab of your absence and expected return as soon as you can. Specific details regarding graduation requirements, stipend payments, TA responsibilities, etc. during extended leave depends on the lab member’s student/employment status, current funding sources, and research progress, so these issues will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
