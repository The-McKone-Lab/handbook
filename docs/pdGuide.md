# Postdoctoral Researcher Guide

Postdocs are in a unique position in a laboratory since their tenure is generally shorter than that of PhD students, but they are also more experienced and have fewer requirements compared to grad students.
Postdocs also have the most diverse set of plausible goals: some might seek specific research experience for a well-defined employment opportunity; others might be looking to expand their skill set more generally so as to improve future job prospects; others might be interested in taking on administrative or mentorship roles in preparation for future work in academics, government, or industry.
Any of these goals is excellent, but it is very important that you communicate your intentions clearly to Prof. McKone beginning during the interview process and continuing well after beginning work in the lab.

Postdocs will likely spend between one and three years in the McKone
lab. Expectations regarding research effort and output are similar to
those of senior graduate students. A good rule of thumb is to focus on
at least one primary project and one or more secondary project or
collaboration at all times. Postdocs are particularly encouraged to seek
out collaborations with other research groups and to integrate their
previous research experience with our own so as to expand the group’s
expertise. Also as with graduate students, postdocs should be broadly
responsible for drafting research reports and manuscripts.

Postdocs are strongly encouraged to apply for external research funding
through grants and fellowships. Many of these require independent
reports to be submitted, and these provide good practice for future work in
the academic, government, or industrial sectors. Postdocs should also
make an effort to integrate into the research community at Pitt by
attending seminars and presenting their research. As with graduate
students, Prof. McKone will work to facilitate travel to at least one
external conference annually.

Most of the time, postdocs are looking to transition from their current
position toward long-term employment elsewhere. Therefore it is very
important to begin pursuing potential job opportunities at least 6
months to a year before your intended departure. Over the last several
years the job market in the chemical sciences has been tightening, and
so finding a job often requires a great deal of effort. It is perfectly
acceptable to consider the job search as part of your work role as a
postdoc. This means that, e.g., traveling for job interviews and working
on applications can be considered as productive work time, even at the
expense of short-term progress on your research projects. Prof. McKone
will put forward as much effort as he can to help you make connections
to further your career, whether that means writing recommendation
letters, sending you to conferences for networking purposes, or helping
to facilitate personal connections.

Here are some additional tips and suggestions for postdocs:

-   Seek out regular interactions with more than one research mentor.
    For one reason, cross-pollinating ideas between research groups is
    fun and rewarding. For another, consider that most employers require
    at least three reference letters for applicants. Usually this means
    your thesis advisor, your postdoc advisor, and at least one “wild
    card“ letter writer. The most compelling reference letters usually
    come from mentors who know you well and are familiar with your most
    recent accomplishments. That said, be careful about becoming
    administratively involved in more than one research group, as being
    an ”official" member of more than one group only works well
    if you and both primary investigators are in close agreement about
    your responsibilities to each.

-   It is a good idea to keep your CV current and to keep on hand a few business cards with your contact information. You never know when a potential employment opportunity will arise. Nowadays it is also worthwhile to purchase and maintain a simple website that compiles your professional information and provides a way for others to contact you electronically. That way, even if a potential employer loses your business card, she/he can find you using a simple internet search. Social media can also be helpful in this context, but bear in mind that mixing personal and professional interactions on social media can be off-putting for potential employers.  

-   Moderate your self-expectations in the first few months of
    the postdoc. The transition from one institution to another is
    always jarring, and it usually takes at least 6 months before a
    postdoc can attain anywhere near the level of productivity that
    she/he sustained at the peak of graduate school. So take it easy
    initially and don’t get down on yourself.

-   Plan the content and execution of your research projects carefully.
    Since postdocs work on a relatively short time frame, good planning
    and careful work are especially important. Be sure to talk to
    coworkers and Prof. McKone regularly within your first several
    months of postdoctoral work to ensure that your research
    plans are likely to lead to productive outcomes.

-   Vigorously pursue external research funding. Postdoctoral fellowship
    and grant programs are nowadays few and far between, but external
    funding significantly increases your flexibility as a postdoc. They
    also greatly improve your credibility as an independent thinker,
    which most employers find very important. Not to mention the pay is
    almost always better!

-   Connect with other postdocs in your field, both locally and nationally. Many of them will remain your colleagues for years to come, and there is no better time to begin building relationships. Keeping in touch with other postdocs can also be helpful in the interest of “comparing notes" about employment opportunities and current trends in research. Consider as a relevant example that Prof. McKone was first made aware of the tenure-track opening at Pitt through a personal connection with Prof. Keith, and not through a formal job posting!

-   Actively pursue multiple career options. Many postdocs are targeting a
    specific career outcome, but
    personal circumstances and external factors can change those plans
    in a hurry! Think of it this way: wise career choices are only made
    with full awareness of all of the available possibilities. So even
    if your goal is, e.g., a position at a national lab, consider
    pursuing interviews in industrial labs as well in the interest of
    keeping your options open and validating your final decision with
    knowledge rather than speculation about the alternatives.
