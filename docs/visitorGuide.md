# Visiting Researcher Guide

From time to time, we welcome research visitors from other institutions to work in our lab. These visitors might range in expertise and seniority from high school students to professors. Visiting grad students and postdocs should consider themselves to be McKone group grad students and postdocs for the time that they are Pitt, with all of the attendant rules and recommendations. Visiting senior scientists are simply asked to follow the rules and recommendations for the McKone group that best apply to them. Minors who visit or work in our lab will need to be managed by an appropriate mentor or guardian, whose role will be outlined on an individual basis.

The most important thing for all visitors to keep in mind is that exceptions will not be made to any of the lab rules and operating procedures for visitors, regardless of their level of experience or seniority. We acknowledge that your visit might be brief or highly informal, or your home research group or institution might have rules or procedures that are different from ours. We are often happy to discuss alternative experimental or administrative approaches in the interest of improving our lab. Nevertheless, we expect visitors to adhere to the rules regarding safety, interpersonal behavior, etc. that are spelled out in this lab handbook, and to accept the consequences for violations.
