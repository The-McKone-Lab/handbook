# Documenting Your Work

These are recommendations for how McKone lab members should document and present their work, including general guidelines on keeping lab notes, writing formal and informal documents, and preparing presentations.

## Keeping track of your lab work

It’s important to document your work carefully in a lab notebook. Lab members have a handful of options when it comes to selecting the format for their lab notes:

-   Standard paper notebook
-   Electronic notes, e.g., using LabArchives or Microsoft OneNote

Of course a paper notebook is still the most “tried and true" method to keep track of lab work. Most lab members have likely kept paper notes in their high school or undergraduate science lab courses; keeping notes in a research group like ours is very similar. All pages should be numbered and entries should be dated. The researcher’s name and contact information should be written in the inside cover. When a project is complete or a notebook is filled, the researcher should sign and date the final page (or back cover) to indicate that the work has been finalized and that it was described and documented accurately. Although nowadays most data is collected and stored in digital format, researchers using paper notebooks should print out graphical results and paste or tape them into their notebook in an entry dated according to when the data were collected.

Prof. McKone recommends use of electronic lab notebooks. He used Microsoft OneNote to keep track of his graduate and postdoc work from 2010–2016 to good effect, and he also has some (generally positive) experience with LabArchives. Nowadays the vast majority of data collection in lab is done with the help of computers, so one is always close at hand. In addition to OneNote, which offers a free-form template for note-taking, Pitt maintains a university-wide license for LabArchives, which offers more built-in features for lab researchers as well as an online interface at the expense of a bit more clutter. Other software for electronic notes is also available, and lab members are encouraged to consult with senior colleagues or Prof. McKone to help decide which medium would be best for their notes.

Regardless of the format used, research notes should provide a narrative description, as well as raw and/or graphical data as appropriate, for every single experiment a researcher attempts. Documentation should be clear and complete to facilitate reproduction or analysis by another researcher with a comparable skill level. A good rule of thumb is to imagine yourself opening your notebook to a random entry 6 months after it was written, such that your specific memory of the day has faded. You should be able to use the notebook entry alone to accurately reproduce the experiment and achieve comparable results. In fact, in many cases this is exactly what researchers do when it comes to collecting a few final datasets to round out a manuscript or a thesis.

Data analysis (which includes preparing and discussing plots, diagrams etc.) should be accomplished contemporaneously or shortly after completion of the corresponding experiment, and it should be clearly documented in your notebook. There are a lot of excellent software packages that can be used for quantitative and statistical data analysis and visualization. Prof. McKone likes to prioritize use of free and open tools, so preference would be to use Python libraries (e.g., SciPy, NumPy, Pandas) or the R software package for analysis. Other options include Matlab, Mathematica, Origin, Sigmaplot, and Excel, all of which can be obtained for free or at a discount for academic use.

As mentioned above, raw data will likely be in digital format. In the unlikely event that you generate data in “hard copy," it best to digitize it with a scanner or camera. Files should be named using a consistent, understandable syntax, archived, and stored in a central location with regular backups. Currently active members of the group can analyze and store data on personally owned computers if they choose, and we will also provide access to shared group computers and a dataserver for storage. Cloud data storage services like Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, and others also work nicely for storing and archiving data. When possible, always try to export and store digital data in non-proprietary formats. Usually this means plaintext files with comma or tab-delimited values, or established open formats like XML. When in doubt, talk to a colleague or Prof. McKone about the best format location for storing data.

Prof. McKone and others will request informal reports from time to time to construct presentations, grant proposals, and group research reports. In most cases the documents you provide do not need to follow a particular format, and you can use whatever software you want to prepare the documents. Word processors such as Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, LibreOffice Writer, or Google Documents are available at low or no cost, and they can handle small and medium-sized documents containing text and graphics without much difficulty.

Researchers who have completed their work in the McKone group should make available a copy of all of their notes. If you kept paper notes, this means collecting your notebooks and giving them to Prof. McKone for storage. For digital notes it is best to export everything in an appropriate archival format and to also make available the source files. All raw data, notes, etc., should then be saved to shared server space.

## Presenting Your Work

Each member of our group will have ample opportunities to prepare and deliver presentations at internal group meetings and external seminars. Usually this means preparing visual aids using presentation software. Microsoft Powerpoint is by far the most common piece of software used for this purpose, and it works well. Alternatives include Apple Keynote, Google Documents Slides, LibreOffice Impress, and Prezi. In the interest of interoperability, it is recommended that you export presentation slides to PDF before sharing them with others, or if you are delivering your talk on a machine that is not your own.

For internal meetings, there is no need for fancy formatting, but make sure all of your visual aids are legible and appropriately labeled (especially axis labels!). Formal seminars, thesis defense presentations, etc. should be prepared more carefully with attention paid to both content and aesthetics. From time to time we may discuss best practices for preparing visual aids and delivering excellent presentations.

For poster preparation, Powerpoint is also the most commonly used software, but it doesn’t handle the large resulting file sizes very well. Other software is also available, such as Adobe Illustrator/InDesign, Inkscape, or Apple Pages, which seem to work better for this application. Posters should always be exported and proofed in PDF format prior to final printing.
