# Graduate Student Guide

As a graduate student, your primary goal is to accumulate knowledge,
experience, and research accomplishments that collectively merit
awarding of a graduate degree (master’s and/or PhD).
You will deepen your knowledge through coursework, advance the field of chemical
engineering through research, and contribute to the missions of the CPE
department through teaching and service.

The specific requirements for graduate studies in CPE at Pitt are enumerated in two bulletins: the [SSOE graduate bulletin][SSOEbull] and the [chemical and petroleum engineering graduate bulletin][CPEbull].
To be awarded a graduate degree, students will need to complete those requirements and demonstrate substantial progress in original research as reflected in a thesis/dissertation.
For a master’s degree, progress on one primary project is sufficient, whereas for a PhD the dissertation should discuss several research accomplishments.
Ideally a master’s student will complete his/her degree in 1–2 years and publish at least one paper as a the leading author; ideally PhD students will finish in 5 years and publish three or more papers as the leading authors.
These publication guidelines, however, are not absolute requirements.
Prof. McKone places a high priority on graduating PhDs within 5 years, and he is very reluctant to keep anyone on for more than 6, regardless of his/her progress toward completion of the degree.

For the sake of convenience, it makes sense to classify master’s and PhD students in their first year or two as *junior graduate students*, and those who have passed their exams and are in their third year or beyond as *senior graduate students*.

The first two years comprise a transition from primarily coursework, which emphasizes well-established principles, toward original research, which emphasizes new ideas.
Junior graduate students are encouraged to concentrate on coursework and teaching responsibilities, especially in the first semester or two.
In terms of research, try to target one well-defined research project initially.
Writing a master’s thesis and/or passing the PhD qualifying exam will require that you can demonstrate a high level of proficiency in the broad principles of chemical engineering and that you have made progress toward original insights in the laboratory.

Upon passing the qualifying exam, senior graduate students focus
more directly on making progress in the lab.
A good way to structure your lab work is to maintain one primary project at all times and to
maintain one or more additional “side" projects.
Primary projects are likely to yield lead-author publications, and they will be the
main focus of your dissertation.
A side project might be a collaboration with a colleague at Pitt or elsewhere, where you are providing some specific expertise or insight, or it might be an original research idea
that needs some promising preliminary results before meriting more detailed attention.
These efforts will lead to co-authorship on publications, or they may become primary projects later.

Along with lab work, graduate students have several other responsibilities.
Each student will likely be placed in charge of one or
more instruments or apparatus in the lab, which carries the
responsibilities of maintenance and training.
Senior students should also consider mentoring undergraduates or junior lab members.
Graduate students should also be keeping up with the published literature in
their area of study, and they should attend research seminars on campus regularly.

It is important for graduate students to develop skills in presenting
their work to technical and non-technical audiences.
Thus, in addition to regular internal group meeting presentations, each student should try to
give one or two public research presentations per year, beginning in the
second year.
There are many opportunities to present research publicly on the Pitt campus or elsewhere in the immediate vicinity (e.g., at local conferences or one of the other universities in Pittsburgh) as part of a poster session or seminar series.
Prof. McKone will also try to provide opportunities for each graduate student
to attend one or more national conferences (e.g. AICHE, ACS, MRS, Gordon
Conference, etc.) during their Pitt tenure.
Expenses for trips to conferences will be covered through laboratory funds or travel-specific
grants/fellowships, but keep in mind that local meetings are the easiest to fund.

Graduate students are also asked to take significant responsibility for writing manuscripts and informal reports.
Prof. McKone will work with junior graduate students as closely as needed to draft their first manuscripts, whereas senior graduate students may reach a level of fluency that they will only need editorial input and final approval from Prof. McKone prior to submission.
From time to time, Prof. McKone will also ask for brief research reports or graphical data in order to prepare external presentations and progress reports.
Grad students need not be directly involved in writing research proposals, but those who are interested in learning more about that process are welcome to contribute upon request.

Here are a handful of additional tips for grad students:

-   As Prof. McKone’s graduate thesis advisor Harry Gray used to say,
    “Don’t peak too soon!" This means don’t get down on
    yourself for not having earth-shattering results right away in your
    graduate career. Most students don’t really hit their stride until
    they are approaching graduation.

-   Begin planning for the qualifying and thesis examinations well ahead
    of time---4 months or more for quals and perhaps 9 months or more for
    the thesis exam. These events are inevitable sources of stress, but
    starting to think about them very early allows you to approach them
    at a measured pace.

-   Keep your piles small: don’t let un-analyzed data,
    unfinished manuscripts, ungraded homework, etc. build up. Many people
    find that the thing they least like to do tends to be the very thing
    that accumulates, and then it comes to dominate their existence.
    Completing each of your major tasks roughly in the order that they
    arrive is a good way to keep this from happening.

-   Read a lot of papers! It is amazing how often a few hours spent
    reading the published literature can save days of effort in the lab.
    Set aside some regular time every week (a few hours at least) to
    review the current literature. Also, before starting a new project,
    it is advisable to spend as much as several days familiarizing
    yourself with the current and historical literature on the topic.

-   Don’t be afraid to take time just to think carefully about your
    research projects. Many grad students make the mistake of trying to
    run as many experiments as is humanly possible, and in doing so they
    fail to plan any single experiment with adequate care. A useful
    rule of thumb is that you should learn something useful from every
    single experiment you run.

-   Maintain multiple lines of inquiry in the lab. It really stinks when
    your main line of research gets "stuck" due to some unforeseen
    challenge or, even worse, some delay that is out of your
    control (e.g. instrument is down). If you follow the model of having
    one main project and several minor projects, it becomes easier to
    fill in those gaps with work that is productive and hopefully more
    satisfying than just waiting to get "un-stuck."

-   Be a whole person. Although this was already mentioned in terms of
    maintaining a balanced lifestyle, it bears repeating. Nothing leads
    to burnout faster or more consistently than acting like an automaton
    whose single purpose is to churn out lab work and nothing else.
    Cultivate your interests in areas other than your own research,
    scientific or otherwise. Grad students are allowed to be real
    people!

-   Try as best you can to become intellectually and materially
    independent from your peers and from your advisor. The more you can
    accomplish without regular input or instructions from others, the
    more successful you are likely to be in grad school and beyond.

-   Although it’s important to be intellectually independent, try also
    to keep in close touch with members of other labs. Engage them in
    conversation about your work and theirs. It is easy for university
    research labs to become "silos" with relatively little
    external interaction. This is, for one thing, socially awkward, and
    for another it can lead to very narrow and uncreative thinking. So
    try to keep the conversation going with your community of peers at
    Pitt from your first year right through graduation.
