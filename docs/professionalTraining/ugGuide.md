# Undergraduate Guide

We are always excited to involve undergraduate students in research.
Whether working over the summer or during the school year, undergrads
can have a significant impact on our collective efforts, and they will
also reap positive benefits for their own intellectual development and career prospects. In
general, undergraduate students should keep in mind three goals. First,
lab work allows you to diversify and enhance your undergraduate
education with hands-on experience. Second, lab work can inform
decisions about future education and career objectives. Third,
successful lab work can greatly increase your credibility and
competitiveness for later educational and career opportunities,
especially in STEM-related areas.

In general, undergrads will work in close collaboration with one or more
graduate or postdoc mentors. These mentorship relationships should be
established by mutual interest and explicit agreement to work together.
That is, Prof. McKone will not “assign" undergraduates to work
with particular grad students or postdocs; rather he will direct
interested students toward lab members who might make a good match
with an undergraduate mentee. Undergrad students who are interested in
our group are encouraged to contact Prof. McKone or existing group
members directly to get this mentorship conversation started.

Undergraduate researchers and their mentors should invest significant
time up front to create a well-defined research plan. That plan should
focus on exposing you to a variety of research tools and
methods, and it should clearly delineate research problems and
hypotheses to justify and motivate the work. It is important to avoid
scenarios where an undergrad researcher simply functions as an spare
pair of hands assisting his/her mentor’s work. In most cases it is best
to create a brief proposal or outline of the planned research activities
to make sure you, your mentor, and Prof. McKone are all
on the same page.

Regarding specific research projects, two broad categories are natural
fits for undergrads. The first is where the undergrad researcher takes
on a brand new challenge that the group has not attempted previously.
This “high-risk, high-reward" research is very exciting, but it
might be inadvisable for grad students or postdocs since it is less
likely to lead to results that can be published or included in a thesis.
This type of project might be perfect for an undergrad who is ambitious
and not easily discouraged by unsuccessful or unanticipated outcomes.
The second type of project is where the undergrad pursues original work
that parallels or expands on that of her/his mentor. For example, if the
mentor has been synthesizing and characterizing catalyst materials
comprised of elements A and B, the undergraduate mentee might work on
catalysts containing elements A and C. Bear in mind that there should
always be a coherent rationale for the departure from the mentor’s work,
and you should be intellectually and materially responsible
for advancing your own work in spite of any overlap with that of your mentor.

Since undergraduates enter the lab with a modest amount of previous
experience, there are a few additional rules that you are asked to
follow. The first rule is that *coursework always comes first*. We
certainly hope that working in our lab will enhance your education, but
it should be seen as an extra-curricular or co-curricular activity. Thus
it should not directly interfere with your course schedule and
commitments. Under no circumstances should an undergraduate lab member
forsake course responsibilities (e.g. class attendance,
homework) in favor of working in the lab. Neither is lab work a valid
excuse for not completing course work. If you are struggling to balance
course responsibilities with lab work, please consult with your mentor
and/or Prof. McKone to consider modifying your research focus as needed
to better accommodate your availability.

Undergraduates are also asked to obey a more stringent rule regarding
supervision: never work in the lab space without at least one
grad student or postdoc also present. The supervising lab member need
not be your mentor, nor do they need to explicitly monitor your work,
but he/she should be available to help in case you have questions or in the unlikely event of an emergency.
This rule means that in some cases undergrads will need to coordinate working hours
carefully with other lab members, especially during the school year.
Course schedules may dictate that the most convenient time for an
undergrad to work might be at odd hours (e.g. after dinner or on
weekends). Although it is perfectly fine to work during those times, it
is not safe to assume that a grad student or postdoc will always be
available to supervise.

Undergraduates who are actively working in the McKone group are
considered “full" lab members, in the sense that they will be provided
office space and access to the lab just as with any other researcher to the extent that the department allows.
In return, you are required to take full part in lab responsibilities,
including cleaning and upkeep of lab and office spaces. You should make arrangements to attend weekly laboratory meetings.
You will also be included in the rotation for giving research presentations.
In most cases, however, multiple undergraduates will be scheduled for one
meeting to allow for shorter talks.
If our meetings or other group activities conflict with school or extracurricular responsibilities,
accommodations can be made in consultation with Prof. McKone.

A few other tips and suggestions for undergraduates are worth mentioning:

-   Seek out conversations and advice from more than one group member.
    Although you will have one or perhaps two formal mentors, many group
    members might have useful insights regarding your research project
    or helpful advice regarding coursework or future career options.

-   Plan your time in lab carefully. Summer research periods are short
    (usually 8–10 weeks), and so it is important to avoid hastily
    devised forays in directions that end up being unproductive for your
    project or your learning. Research during the school year is even
    harder, as undergrads usually cannot spend more than a few hours in
    the lab at a time. The most important thing to remember in this
    context is to always plan ahead and set realistic goals about what
    you can accomplish in the time you have available.

-   Prioritize intellectual independence in
    your research. This means developing your own working knowledge of
    every aspect of your project so that you don’t rely on your mentor
    for instructions on what to do next or what results to expect. In
    this context, excellent undergraduate researchers can become so
    independent that they effectively function as junior grad students. This is a
    desirable outcome, but keep in mind that it usually takes multiple
    summers and semesters of diligent work to reach that point.

-   Don’t be afraid to propose new experiments. Grad students,
    postdocs, and professors do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Once
    you gain some experience in a lab setting, all likelihood is that
    you will have interesting ideas of your own that might be
    worth pursuing. Talk to your mentor about those ideas and develop a
    plan to push the project in directions that you find exciting.

-   If you are dissatisfied or not enjoying your work, let someone know.
    Sometimes a research project just turns out to be a “dud," or maybe
    it isn’t right for your temperament. If that is the case, it is
    usually very easy to find something different to do. It is possible
    that you will simply decide that our research methods and approaches aren’t right
    for you, in which case Prof. McKone would be happy to work with you
    to consider opportunities in other labs.
