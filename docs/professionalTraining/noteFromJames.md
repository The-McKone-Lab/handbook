# Preamble: a note from James

Greetings and thanks again for your interest and/or involvement in our research group.
I am providing here a short note that I hope will provide some insight
regarding my personal philosophy and approach to professorship.

My primary role as a professor is to guide my group members and other Pitt students toward successful outcomes.
Those outcomes are defined by the requirements of the university and by the goals of the students/researchers themselves.
For example, a successful graduate student will gain a high level of expertise in one or more topics associated with his/her thesis research through dedicated work in the classroom, the laboratory, and the broader community.
Ideally he/she will leave with an excellent record of publication and service and demonstrable skills that will make for a smooth transition to the next vocational opportunity.

A large proportion of my intellectual and physical energy goes into
mentoring graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduates in my lab.
As a mentor, I try to emphasize autonomy, respect, and accountability for each member
of the group.
Although I often have my own ideas and thoughts as to the
most exciting and tractable experiments to run, I strongly encourage
everyone to develop and pursue her/his own research ideas
and to freely exchange ideas both inside and outside our group.

My responsibilities also encompass teaching and service roles.
Along with most of the other professors in the CPE department at Pitt, I teach
one course per semester on average at the graduate or undergraduate
level.
I place a high priority on teaching, and I do my best to take
adequate time to prepare for lectures and office hours and to write
homework problems and exams.
My service work includes committee and
administrative functions for the CPE department, and I provide broader
service to the engineering community, e.g., by organizing and
chairing sessions at the annual AICHE meeting.
I strongly encourage all graduate students and postdocs to become involved in at least one
teaching and service opportunity during their tenure at Pitt, regardless of your vocational goals.

Another important area of service is community outreach.
During my graduate and postdoctoral years, I spent a
significant amount of time working with secondary school and
undergraduate students on activities and research projects intended to
increase their efficacy toward the STEM disciplines.
I continue to pursue interesting outreach opportunities as a professor, and I hope
that members of my group will involve themselves in outreach efforts as
well.
It is extremely rewarding!

Practically, I spend my time at Pitt (in rough order of most to least time) writing, talking, reading, and thinking.
Being an assistant professor means that I spend a lot of time writing grant proposals and preparing lectures.
I also spend lots of time talking with colleagues and lab members in meetings, one-on-one discussions, and over the phone.
I travel regularly to give seminars at conferences and at other universities, in order to disseminate our work and to promote our lab and Pitt research as a whole.
I read reports, theses, manuscript drafts, and the published literature to keep up with the latest work of interest to our group.
Finally, I find it important to set aside regular time to brainstorm and develop ideas alone and in collaboration with my students and colleagues.
Conspicuously absent from this list is time spent running experiments!
I am available to help develop and teach laboratory procedures, and I expect to spend some time in lab collecting preliminary data, but for the most part I leave lab work to students and postdocs.

I place a high priority on maintaining a balanced lifestyle.
I try not to overwork myself and to make healthy life choices.
This means, for example, trying to get adequate sleep each night, spending time with my family,
exercising regularly, and eating well.
My ideal work schedule is to spend no more than 50 hours per week in and around the lab. I sometimes
do additional work from home, but I try to completely disconnect for one
full day per week (usually Saturdays).
I also stay active with several hobbies unrelated to my work at Pitt, which include cooking, watching movies, reading, and playing and listening to music.
I encourage all members of my research group to make an effort to maintain a balanced
lifestyle.
Your work and overall happiness will benefit as a result.

I will conclude with some general advice on how we can work fruitfully
together.
First, keep in mind that I am splitting my time and attention
between multiple projects and responsibilities inside and outside of our
lab.
This means that the best approach you can take is to consistently
try “manage up” by telling me how I can be most helpful to you.
More broadly, be active and direct in describing what you need from me and from your peers.
If you are comfortable, I also value feedback on whether or not you find my input and advice helpful.
In the same way, I will try to give clear encouragement and constructive criticism in appropriate and balanced measures.
Finally, above all I recommend that you trust your own good sense.
All likelihood is that you know more than anyone else about your
own work, and so you are in the best position to make wise choices on
how to proceed.
