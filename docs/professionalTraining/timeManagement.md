# Managing your time

The following is a rough outline of a schedule that might be typical of a full-time researcher in an academic lab who makes good use of their time. 
It is presented simply as a list of activities and the number of hours per week that one might spend on each without any specific recommendations about which hours of the day or days of the week should be spent on which. 

## Outline of Activities

### Actively work on lab experiments: 30 hours/week

* Plan lab experiments (write plans in your notebook!)
* Execute lab experiments (note real-time observations in your notebook!)
* Work up your data (fully document in your notebook)
* Analyze experiments results (write out all your thoughts in the lab notebook)
* (In case you can't tell, keeping a good lab notebook is VERY important here) 

### Read the research literature: 5 hours/week

* Keep an organized list of papers and topic areas
* Note important papers as you read (in your lab notebook!)
* Develop some habits or tools that allow you to keep up with latest work (RSS feeds, twitter, etc.)
* Note that 5 hours/week is enough time to browse nearly everything relevant to your project and carefully study perhaps 1 to 3 papers/week

### Discuss work with others: 5 hours/week

* Discuss what you are doing casually with friends/labmates
* Discuss results formally in group meetings, subgroups, one-on-ones, etc.
* Note that keeping a really detailed lab notebook saves A LOT of time that you might spend here getting your data into a format that is understandable to others

### Disseminate results: 5 hours/week

* Writing reports, publications, etc. - worth trying to do 
* Presentations - posters, seminars, conferences and the associated preparation
* Avoid the temptation to do this only when you have to - try to do at last a few hours of writing and figure preparation every single week

### Professional development activities: 3 hours/week

* Formal PD activities like seminars, extra courses, trainings
* Informal self-directed activities like reading papers/tutorials in some new area

### Reflective thinking: 2 hours/week

* Best divided into relatively small chunks - perhaps 20-30 mins/day
* Ask reflective questions like "What am I trying to do here?" & "Do my latest results make sense?"
* Daydream, get creative, and write down crazy ideas you might have

### Other activities: (minimize total time spent)

* Ramp down/up time associated with switching tasks
* Administrative tasks: emails, ordering, scheduling; etc.
* Fixing broken stuff
* Administrative delays: waiting for materials, collaborators' data, etc. 

## Additional Notes 

### Less than full time
This summary applies best to people who do not have many obligations outside of their lab responsibilities and can therefore by described as full-time researchers. 
This might include PhD researchers who have completed all required coursework, postdocs, or undergraduates engaged in a summer research fellowship. 
If you have less time available due to coursework or other obligations, you should still follow the guidelines above (i.e., don't cut corners by greatly scaling back your effort on any of the areas above) and plan for proportionally slower progress overall. 
As an extreme example, an undergraduate doing 3 hours of lab work per week can be expected to accomplish about 1 week's worth of "full time" effort in a whole semester. This is probably enough to design and execute one really good set of experiments along with the associated lit review, writing, etc.

### Counting hours
If you actually add up the recommended time commitments, the sum is 50 hours/week.
This is roughly consistent with the average weekly laboratory time commitment that James has observed of many very successful researchers. 
It is also possible to accomplish the full effort above in less than 50 hours total by planning your time in the lab strategically so that idle periods (e.g., time spent waiting for a reaction to be done) are occupied with one of the other tasks. 
Hence, it is absolutely possible, with some planning and practice, to accomplish academic research at the highest level while working a standard US workweek of 40 hours/week.

However, any amount of time spent on the tasks above may translate to many more hours spent in and around the lab, because lots of people spend considerable amounts of time socializing or pursuing other non-research activities alongside their lab work. This is completely fine, but be wary of falling into the common trap of assuming that spending >>40 hours per week at work will automatically make you successful. 

### Overloading and burnout
Consider also that it is certainly possible, and sometimes helpful or necessary, to put more time into any of the activities above. 
It is also possible to spend much more than 50 hours per week on productive lab work, but attempting to do this for more than a few weeks at a time is a recipe for exhaustion and burnout. 
Thus, any period of time in which you are putting in a lot of extra hours in the lab (e.g., making a final push for a manuscript submission) should generally be followed by at least a week or two of more relaxed work, or perhaps even a vacation!

### Daily schedule
No recommendations have been made here about whether there are better or worse times of day to do any specific task. 
You are encouraged to experiments to figure out whether, for example, you prefer to start the day with lab work or writing tasks. 
But in general it is a good idea to stick with a single task for at least an hour (to minimize inefficiencies associated with switching tasks) but not more than 2-3 hours at a time without changing focus or taking a short break.

Neither have any explicit recommendations been made above about when to begin and end your day.
Good work can certainly be done on an unusual schedule, e.g., that begins at 5am and ends in the mid-afternoon, or one that begins at noon and continues into night.
Nonetheless, you are strongly encouraged to develop a regular schedule for daily work where a high proportion of the hours you spend in our lab spaces overlap with time spent by others.
This is important for safety (don't work alone!) and also to facilitate opportunities to give and receive help from your labmates when it is needed.
