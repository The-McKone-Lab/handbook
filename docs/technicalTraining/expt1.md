# Your first experiment

This tutorial outlines an experiment that every new member of the McKone lab is expected to accomplish prior to beginning their own research project. This experiment encompasses many of basic principles of electrochemical measurements and materials synthesis. Another type of activity that our lab members do a lot of is materials characterization in external facilities (e.g., the NFCF) that require separate training.

The point here is not just to get these experiments done, or to get the equivalent of an "A" on the assignment. Rather, the point is to familiarize yourself with our lab space and our tools using experiments where we know what the result should be. Accordingly, you are strongly encouraged to get help from senior lab members or James to complete this experiment and talk through the results. Optional extensions are also outlined if you want some ideas for next steps to build more skills or learn more tools. 

Once you have successfully run Experiment 1 (and talked through the results with James), the next step should be to devise the first experiment of your own individual research project. This should be done in consultation with your research mentor (e.g., a grad student or a senior colleague or James) and will usually involve reproducing a more complicated experiment from one of our recent publications that is closely related to your project.

## Outline of Experiment 1

The ouline below summarizes tasks associated with completion of Experiment 1. If you are not already trained as an electrochemist, you will need to seek help from another lab member to complete these tasks. Because everyone in lab is required to complete this task before beginning their work, literally anyone can help you. If you are already well-versed in electrochemistry, you still need to complete this experiment and discuss the results with James before you are allowed to begin working freely in our lab.

**SAFETY NOTE: ALWAYS document a safety plan in your notebook before running an experiment for the first time.** 

### Steps:

-   Set up an electrochemical cell with 0.1 or 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte
-	Get your own Ag/AgCl and Pt (or graphite) counter electrode and insert into cell
-	Set up a proper nitrogen or argon purge to exclude air from the electrolyte
-	Clean and polish a standard (non-rotating) platinum disk electrode
-	Protect the surface with a drop of clean water
-	Insert Pt electrode into cell and take a set of CVs
-	Vary the voltage window within the range from -0.1 to 1.5 V vs RHE
-	Vary the scan rate in the range from 20 to 1000 mV/s
-	Work up the CV data using scientific computing software
-	Fully document procedure and results in lab notebook
-	Discuss results with labmates to understand what is going on
-	Quantify hydrogen adsorption/desorption features to estimate surface area
-	Meet with James individually to talk through results

### Optional Extensions:

1.	Repeat Experiment 1 using an RDE and measure the HER.
2.	Repeat Experiment 1 using commercial or home-made Pt nanoparticles and compare the ECSA you calculate from HUPD to what would be expected based purely on the geometry and mass loading of Pt on your electrode.
3.  Extend to HOR/ORR catalysis measurements using H2 or O2 purge, respectively.
4.	Follow analogous procedure to collect CVs of 10 mM Fe3+ in 0.1 M HCl and analyze results in terms of diffusional vs surface behavior and reversibility.
