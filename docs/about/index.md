# About our lab

We conduct experimental research that incorporates multiple disciplines
within the chemical sciences including chemistry, chemical
engineering, materials science, and solid-state physics. We are focused
on addressing interesting and important challenges related to
environmental and societal sustainability. Our ultimate goal is to
develop and improve technologies that positively impact the world around
us. We work toward this goal by taking an approach to research that can be
summarized as follows:

1.  Identify a problem or challenge that we would like to address

2.  Become familiar with historical factors, including the origin of the
    problem and previous/current attempts to solve it

3.  Develop a detailed understanding of the basic physical and chemical
    processes underlying the challenge

4.  Propose a technical advance that will (a) contribute to better
    understanding the problem or (b) take a tangible step toward solving it

5.  Carry out experiments to realize that technical advance

6.  Disseminate our findings openly to a wide audience
