# Guides

This section of the handbook includes a brief note from Professor McKone
regarding his approach to research mentorship.
That is followed by short
guides for each type of researcher that works in the McKone lab---graduate
students, undergraduates, postdoctoral researchers, and visiting
scientists.
These guides spell out in greater detail expectations for
your work as well as some suggestions for achieving success.
