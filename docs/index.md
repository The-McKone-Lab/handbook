# Welcome

This handbook is being built with the goal of compiling every bit of information that anybody who works in our research group might need to know, and maybe a lot you don't need too. The handbook is very much a work in progress. Talk to James if you are interested in working with him to develop content!

## To Do List



## Software Platform

This handbook uses the mkdocs-material platform. Complete details, including instructions and configuration options, can be found at [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org) and the [mkdocs-material documentation site](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
