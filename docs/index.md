# Welcome!

Welcome to the electronic handbook for the McKone lab. We are a research group based in the chemical engineering department at the University of Pittsburgh, with research programs focused on deploying electrochemistry and engineering design to solve big problems in sustainable energy and chemical manufacturing.

The purpose of this handbook is to compile an authoritative information resource covering topics that are relevant to working in our lab.
