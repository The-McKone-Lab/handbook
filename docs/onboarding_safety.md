# Initial Safety Training

The following is a step-by-step guide for becoming safety trained for work in the McKone lab. Our philosophy on safety is that everyone in the lab, regardless of your specific position and experience level, has equal right to use our research tools, and everyone bears equal responsibility for ensuring that everyone is safe. Accordingly, once you complete all the steps written below, you are free to access our lab space as you wish.

## Step 1: Know the chain of responsiblity

The laboratory PI, James McKone, is ultimately responsible for making sure that everyone who works in our lab is adequately trained to do so safely. If anyone in lab has a question about safety at any time, and especially if you have concerns that others in our lab or any other are not behaving safely, contact James immediately.

The departmental safety liaisons are Prof. Lei Li, who runs the ChE graduate safety committee, and Bob Maniet, who is the ChE department's full time lab manager. Bob in particular is a fantastic resource for safety information as well as instructions on how to go about doing routine administrative tasks like making and receiving orders, installing new equipment, making modifications to our lab facilities, etc. We also have a school-wide administrator named Schohn Shannon, who oversees safety compliance across all of SSOE. If James or Bob are unable to answer your questions, we usually consult with Schohn.

Our current graduate student lab safety officer is Becca Segel. The safety officer's responsibility is to act as a reference point by providing information and training, and to act as a resource to help everyone remain compliant with our safety policies. However, the safety officer is not directly responsible for making sure that everyone is operating safely in the lab, and any serious issues regarding safety compliance should be addressed to James.

## Step 2: Complete department level training

All researchers working in ChE labs must complete the [Online Chemical Hygiene Training](https://pitt.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6MuNLxJssf1zD7L) offered by Pitt EH&S. You should also briefly review Pitt's [Chemical Hygiene plan](https://www.ehs.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/docs/04-001ChemHygienePlan.pdf) to develop a general understanding of policies regarding chemical hazards that are consistent all across campus.
 
There is usually an option to take this training in person instead of online; contact James or the current safety officer for details. At the end of the training, you should be provided with an electronic certificate confirming your completion. Please save this certificate and either print or email it to Bob Maniet along with the "2P..." number on your campus ID. Bob will then add your name and number to electronic log for card access to our lab spaces on the 8th and 9th floors of Benedum as well as the freight elevator that travels between the various floors. 

You may also wish to ask about card access to enter the building after hours and on weekends/holidays. Policies on access restrictions have varied over the last several years, so best to consult with Bob about whether you will need to be added to any other lists. Card access should then be enabled within 48-72 hours.

## Step 3: Complete lab level training

Lab-specific training for our group proceeds in several steps. First, everyone should review the video presentation entitled “chemsafety101” along with the accompanying pdf slide deck, which describe how to go about operating safely in wet chemistry laboratory. The most important piece of information about our lab space is that *we absolutely do work with many hazardous substances*, including toxic and corrosive chemicals, compressed gases, high-speed cutting and grinding tools, high-temperature equipment, and electronics with live voltages. It is incumbent on each of you to respect the hazard of whatever you are working by educating yourself and planning ahead.

You must also schedule an in-person laboratory walkthrough with the lab safety officer or with James. This walkthrough can happen even before you have formally secured lab access since you will be accompanied by a lab safety administrator; the walkthrough will comprise a general tour of our facilities with an emphasis on the main safety hazards associated with all the different tools in our lab, as well as key laboratory infrastructure like eye washes, safety showers, etc.

## Step 4: Document your training

Upon completion of all training tasks above, you must review, fill, and sign the safety onboarding forms (provided by lab safety officer). This can be done in paper format or electronically, and the completed forms should be provided to James prior to the first day you plan to work in lab.

## Step 5: You Are Free to Get to Work!

Once you have completed all these tasks and been granted lab access, you are free to use our lab space and any of the tools (equipment, chemicals, etc.) for which you are properly trained. 

Our policy on additional training for specific pieces of equipment and special hazard chemicals is that you should schedule a separate session with James or a senior lab member to work with you the very first time you use a new tool. One training session is usually enough to get up and running, but you are encouraged to continue seeking assistance from others as you familiarize yourself with the tool. We do not require formal documentation for training on specific lab tools; you are simply asked, on your honor, not to use anything in lab until you are confident that you can do so safely.

Every lab member has equal rights and responsibilities in our lab, and your ability to continue working in our group requires that you embed careful consideration of safety into absolutely everything that you do. If you have any questions or concerns whatsoever, please do not hesitate to contact James, the lab safety officer, or any other knowledgeable lab member.
