# Lab Policies and Onboarding

This section of the handbook covers basic rules and policies for researchers who are working in our lab. It also covers procedures for onboarding and offboarding, so new lab members should review this section when they first join our team.

## Who works in our lab?

Our research group includes graduate students (PhD and MS), postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduates. Effort levels vary from part-time lab research only a handful of hours per week (e.g., undergrads pursuing lab reserach for course credit) to full-time work on the basis of employment by the university (e.g., postdocs).

Regardless of your employment/student status and overall effort level, the policies described in this section apply uniformly and equally to all members of our lab. Another way of saying this is that every member of our lab has **equal rights and equal responsibilites** for maintaining our lab as a safe and professional work environment. Accordingly, all lab members are expected to familiarize themselves with the policies put forward in this section of the handbook when they join our team.

## The chain of responsiblity

The organizational structure of our lab is intentially flat: James is ultimately responsible for everything that transpires in our lab and office spaces. Our lab is also subject to rules and requirements dictated by the department, the university, and various contractual obligations associated with funding agreements that support our research. As a member of our team, you are very welcome to learn about and engage with the larger organizational structure of the university, but bear in mind you are not required (and in some cases not allowed) to handle administrative tasks related to our engagement with the university or any external partners.

To manage the practical elements of lab administration, we operate with a loose hierarchy based on experience, seniority, and a handful of formal responsibilities. For example, undergraduate reseachers are usually partnered with graduate or postdoc researchers in a mentor-mentee relationship. The lab safety officer also has some authority over access to the lab through the requirement for new researchers to complete lab safety training. None of these hierarchical relationships should be taken to mean that any one member of our lab is **working for** any other member of our lab. Rather, everyone in our lab is an automous member of a collaborative team and reports directly to James. This approach is intended as another embodiment of the idea that everyone has equal rights and responsibilites.

## Questions or concerns?

If, after reading this section of the handbook, you have questions or concerns about safe and professional operation in our lab, or if any concerns emerge in the course of your work on our team, please don't hesitate to reach out to James or any other lab member you trust.
