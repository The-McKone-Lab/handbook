# Hybrid and Remote Work Policies

This section is under development. Guidelines outlined below are subject to elaboration or change at a later date once our lab has had an opportunity to discuss further.

The COVID-19 pandemic spurred a significant technological and culture shift toward the adoption of hybrid and remote work.
Our lab is developing a set of formal policies oriented around maximizing flexibility within the practical constraints imposed by our lab's needs.

A general principal that McKone lab members should consider is that the vast majority of research we do involves experiments in our lab space, and this demands regular time operating on campus on an in-person basis. 
This extends not just to your own work, but also your ability to assist others and maintain a safe operating environment.
As such, our lab's default operating posture is that all lab members will execute every aspect of their lab work (i.e., data collection, lit reviewer, writing, etc.) using our on-campus laboratory and office facilities.
However, lab members are free to make arrangements for a work schedule that includes regular remote work, provided these arrangements are discussed with James in advance.

Additional relevant information about remote or hybrid operation are as follows:

* Lab members who are ill or on vacation are under no obligation to attend lab meetings even if it is possible to do so virtually
* Lab members are allowed to make arrangements for extended absences from campus that do not constitute vacations, provided appropraite arrangements are made in advance with James about remote work
