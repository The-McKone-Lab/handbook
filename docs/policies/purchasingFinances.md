# Lab Finances and Purchasing

All lab members share equal responsibility for maintaining a safe and productive work environment. 
This extends to the expenditure of lab funds, which are distributed through various accounts associated with the grants and contracts that support our work.
We strive to maintain a policy of *complete transparency* with regard to financial resources available to the lab.
As such, our lab SharePoint server includes a [lab finances directory](https://pitt.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/mckonelab2/Shared%20Documents/Lab%20Finances?csf=1&web=1&e=RX7okx) containing records of all expenditures and project budgets.
You are free to access this information, and you are also responsible for helping to maintain these records as accurately as possible.

General principles that should be followed for lab expenditures are summarized as follows:

* Lab members should never pay out-of-pocket for expenses explicitly associated with work in our lab
* Lab funds should only be used for laboratory activities and not for personal use
* Small-dollar purchases of laboratory supplies can be made without administrative approval
* Large purchases require approval from James or a designated lab finance administrator
* All purchases

Specific instructions on how to handle various routine uses of lab funds are summarized in the sections below.
Naturally these rules cannot cover every possible situation, so feel free to reach out to James with any questions.

## Salaries and stipends

Most of our lab members recieve some form of compensation or stipend support (strictly speaking stipends are not salaries - feel free to chat with James if you want to talk more about the peculiarities here) while they work in our lab.
Exceptions include undergraduate and Master's students who often complete lab research via enrollment in a specific course for credit.
The list below compiles going rates for salaries and stipends at various levels of experience in our lab.
