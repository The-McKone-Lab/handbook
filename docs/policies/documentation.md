# Documentation

Each member of the McKone lab is required to fully document all laboratory research they complete while a member of our group. 
University policy stipulates that every tangible element of research that is completed on campus or using University resources is the property of the University of Pittsburgh and not the individual researcher.[^1]
As such, the way you should approach research documentation is to think of yourself not just as an individual doing experiments for your own education and advancement, but as a member of the research community at Pitt whose responsibilities include careful curation and preservation of all your work on behalf of our lab and the University as a whole. 

[^1]: Note that individuals do retain some intellectual property rights for the work they complete while at Pitt - these rules are complicated and you are very welcome to discuss with James if you are interested.

## Your responsibilities

As a lab researcher at Pitt, your responsibilities for documentation include keeping a detailed record of (a) the materials you work with; (b) the data you collect; and (c) all the work you complete in analyzing and interpreting those data. 
The requirements described below were intentionally written from a general perspective to ensure maximum flexibility in terms of organizational structure and tools.
Specific recommendations on how to document your work using the resources currently available to our lab can be found in the [Professional Training](../../professionalTraining) section.

### Materials

Our lab works with a wide variety of materials that comprise the objects of our investigation.
Examples include catalysts, electrodes, electrolytes, and reactors.  
Your are responsible for ensuring the materials you work with are indexed with clear labels that allow them to be uniquely identified from any other materials, and that those labels are appropriately incorporated into your lab notes.
Note that this requirement is in addition to the baseline safety requirement to ensure all hazardous substances in lab are appropriately labeled.

### Data

We collect data using a variety of means, most of which entail the generation of digital files from various types of instruments.
Data may also be collected in qualitative or semi-quantitative ways, e.g., by taking photographs of samples or by documentating observations by hand.
Data collection and storage today is almost entirely accomplished digitally via storage of files on computer systems either on a local computer or using interet-based data archive services.
Your responsibility here is to ensure that you are maintaining a comprehensive and well-organized repository of all data that you collect in the lab. 
In practice, this will likely take the form of a digital directory containing files with some well-defined naming convention and organizational structure.

### Analysis and interpretation

The data we collect in the lab usually cannot be immediately translated into meaningful conclusions about physical or performance characteristics of the materials we are studying.
Rather, data generally must be analyzed via the use of scientific computing software to transform one or more datasets into an interpretable result using one or more specific mathematical operations.
Very often the results of those operations are converted into a visual format like a plot, table, or image.
Your responsibility here is to preserve a detailed record of the methods that you used to analyze your data, as well as the final results the analytical operation (new datasets, figures, tables, etc.)
As with data collection, these materials will mainly take the form of digital files that should be organized and maintained in a well-organized digital repository.

### Storage and archival

Your responsibliites in handling materials, data, analysis, and interpretation extend also to ensuring that these materials are properly stored and ultimately archived as appropriate when you depart our lab.
In all cases, this requires that every piece of tangible output (materials, data, analytical scripts, visualizations, etc.) be assigned an identifying label that identifies it uniquely.
In the case of physical materials, you should make arrangements for safe storage of materials that are under active investigation.
In the case of digital media, you should use appropraite hardware and software tools to store the relevant files securely and with redundant backups.
Final archival of data and materials should be carried out as part of your offboarding process, as described in the correponding handbook section.

## Your lab notebook as comprehensive record

The discussion of responsibilities above sounds complicated when requirement is parsed and described in a general way.
But in practice, documenting your lab research is straightforward when you develop the entire process into a consistent workflow for keeping a comprehensive laboratory notebook.
You are strongly encouraged to review the handbook section on best practices for keeping a lab notebook as you develop a strategy for documenting your lab research.
