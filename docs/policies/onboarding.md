# Onboarding information for new lab members

## New members start here!

New lab members should start here to get up and running within our lab and office spaces.
We broadly gate access to McKone lab facilities around initial lab safety training and the completion of one hands-on experiment that we call Experiment 1.
Additional information is also provided below on various administrative items like access to our office space and various digital tools.

## Important names and responsibilities

As the principal investigator of our lab, James is ultimately responsible for managing every aspect of our lab.
As a new lab member, you are very welcome to reach out to James with any questions you have. 

The departmental safety liaisons are Prof. Lei Li, who runs the ChE graduate safety committee, and [Bob Maniet](https://engineering.pitt.edu/people/staff/robert-maniet/), who is the ChE department's full time lab manager. Bob in particular is a fantastic resource for safety information as well as instructions on how to go about doing routine administrative tasks like making and receiving orders, installing new equipment, making modifications to our lab facilities, etc. 
We also have a school-wide administrator named [Schohn Shannon](https://engineering.pitt.edu/people/staff/schohn-shannon/), who oversees facilities management and compliance across the Swanson School. 
If James or Bob are unable to answer your questions, we usually consult with Schohn.

Our lab's onboarding manager is Sammie Roenigk.
The onboarding manager acts as a resource for getting new lab members connected with the right people, handling onboarding paperwork, and administrating access to our lab's digital resources (see below).

Our current graduate student lab safety officer is Becca Segel. 
The safety officer's responsibility is to act as a reference point by providing information and training, and to act as a resource to help everyone remain compliant with our safety policies. 
However, the safety officer is *not* directly responsible for making sure that everyone is operating safely in the lab, and any issues regarding safety compliance should be addressed to James.

## Office access

Members of our lab inhabit two office spaces on the 9th floor of Benedum Engineering Hall along with some additional space in a third office for undergraduate students.
As soon as you have initiated your onboarding process, you are encouraged to contact the onboarding manager and Bob Maniet to find a desk and get a key for one of our offices.
Our offices are equipped with indivdiual desks, whiteboards, a color laser printer, small refrigerators, and a handful of desktop computers and monitors.
Many students choose to use personal computers for work in the offices, but you are free to request access to a dedicated desktop workstation if you prefer.

## Digital resources

Your University of Pittsburgh digital login credentials should be configured automatically in the course of being admitted as a student or hired as a staff member.
These credentials give you access to [Pitt's IT infrastructure](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/), including an email address via a Microsoft 365 account.
Once your Microsoft 365 account is up and running, the lab onboarding manager will add you to our lab's [Microsoft 365 group](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/learn-about-microsoft-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2), which will give you access to our shared calendar and our Sharepoint Server that is used to store and transfer various digital assets.
We also use the Slack platform for messaging, and the onboarding manager should invite you to our lab's Slack group.
If you have any questions about how to gain access or use these resources, consult the onboarding manager or James.

## Getting into lab

### Complete department level training

All researchers working in ChE labs must complete the [Online Chemical Hygiene Training](https://pitt.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6MuNLxJssf1zD7L) offered by Pitt EH&S. You should also briefly review Pitt's [Chemical Hygiene plan](https://www.ehs.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/docs/04-001ChemHygienePlan.pdf) to develop a general understanding of policies regarding chemical hazards that are consistent all across campus.
 
There is usually an option to take this training in person instead of online; contact James or the current safety officer for details if you wish. At the end of the training, you should be provided with an electronic certificate confirming your completion. Please save this certificate and either print or email it to Bob Maniet along with the "2P..." number on your campus ID. Bob will then add your name and number to electronic log for card access to our lab spaces on the 8th and 9th floors of Benedum Engineering Hall as well as the freight elevator that travels between the various floors. 

You may also wish to ask about card access to enter the building after hours and on weekends/holidays. Policies on access restrictions have varied over the last several years, so best to consult with Bob about whether you will need to be added to any other lists. Card access should then be enabled within 48-72 hours.

### Complete lab level training

Lab-specific training for our group proceeds in several steps. 
First, you should review the video presentation entitled “chemsafety101” along with the accompanying pdf slide deck, which describe how to go about operating safely in wet chemistry laboratory. 
The most important piece of information about our lab space is that **we work with many hazardous substances**, including toxic and corrosive chemicals, compressed gases, high-speed cutting and grinding tools, high-temperature equipment, and electronics with live voltages. 
It is incumbent on each of you to *respect the hazard* of whatever you are working by educating yourself and planning ahead.

You must also schedule an in-person laboratory walkthrough with the lab safety officer or with James. 
This walkthrough can happen even before you have formally secured lab access since you will be accompanied by a lab safety administrator; the walkthrough will comprise a general tour of our facilities with an emphasis on the main safety hazards associated with all the different tools in our lab, as well as key laboratory infrastructure like eye washes, safety showers, etc.

### Document your safety training

Upon completion of all training tasks above, you must review, fill, and sign a set of safety onboarding forms that will be provided by the lab safety officer. 
This can be done in paper format or electronically, and the completed forms should be provided to James prior to the first day you plan to work in our lab.

### Complete Experiment 1

Every member of our lab is required to complete the same basic training exercise related to establishing and demonstrating your ability to collect and analyze electrochemical data using a potentiostat and a standard 3-electrode cell configuration.
We affectionately refer to this as **Experiment 1**.
Details for what needs to be completed can be found in the corresponding handbook entry in the Technical Training section.
New members should always be shown how to execute experiment 1 the first time by an existing lab member.
Conveniently, becuase everybody has to complet this experiment, literally anyone in the lab should be able to show you how to do it.
Once you have completed Experiment 1 independently, you should schedule a brief meeting with James to discuss the results. 
During the discussion James will gauge your understanding of the basic physics and chemistry underlying the experiment, and once he is convinced you have a grasp of the fundamentals he will officially designate you as having completed your training for general access to our lab facilities and our electrochemical instrumentation.[^1]

[^1]: James also likes to say that anybody who can successfully execute and explain the Pt voltammetry measurements we use for Experiment 1 is "in the electrochemistry club," because the basic procedures and physical phenomena that you are measuring in that one experiment actually cover a very large fraction of all the basic principles of electrochemistry!

### You are free to work!

Once you have completed all 4 of the tasks above, you are free to use our lab space and any of the tools (equipment, chemicals, etc.) for which you are properly trained. 
Note that our [policy on additional training](../safety/#safety-training-and-access-to-lab-resources) for specific pieces of equipment and special hazard chemicals requires you to schedule a separate session with a more senior lab member to work with you the first time you use a new tool. 
One training session is usually enough to get up and running, but you are encouraged to continue seeking assistance from others as you familiarize yourself with the tool. 
We do not require formal documentation for training on specific lab tools; you are simply asked, on your honor, not to use anything in lab until you are confident that you can do so safely.

Remember that every lab member has equal rights and responsibilities in our lab, and your ability to continue working in our group requires that you embed careful consideration of safety into absolutely everything that you do. If you have any questions or concerns whatsoever, please do not hesitate to contact James, the lab safety officer, or any other knowledgeable lab member.
