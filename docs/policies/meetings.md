# Meetings

Lab members are expected to participate in several types of regular meetings, which are broadly intended to help your remain organized in your lab research and develop skills related to presentation and technical discussion. 
We have organized regular meetings in several ways in our lab over the years, so this handbook section will continue to evolve over time.

{James anticipates writing a separate piece talking about our general philosophy about meetings in the professional training section. That will eventually be linked here.}



## Group Meetings

Our lab meets weekly for one hour as a full group each week.
This meeting is administrated by one lab member at a time on a rotating schedule, and this person is also responsible for delivering a presentation and facilitating discussion. 
The actual meeting agenda includes a brief period at the beginnig of the meeting during which James will bring up any announcements or points he wishes to discuss briefly with the group.
He will then open the floor for discussion or announcement from any lab members on lab business.
After that, the balance of the meeting hour is provided to the designated lab member to use as they see fit.

The **purpose** of our weekly group meeting is to give lab members an opportunity to discuss topics that are relevant to their work or ongoing operations in our lab.
The specific topic is flexible, but examples of worthwhile topics of discussion include

* Delivering highlights of exciting recent work in the lab so we can all celebrate together
* Getting help from other lab members to address a problem you are encountering in the lab 
* Teaching the lab about a useful tool or technique
* Practicing the delivery of a public presentation or oral exam and soliciting feedback from labmates on content, style, and delivery

The exact time and location of the meeting is determined on a semester-by-semester basis to ensure maximimum compatibility with everyone's schedule.
Attendance from all lab members is mandatory except for undergraduates who have course conflicts that cannot be resolved by modifying the meeting schedule.
Lab members are expected to be punctual, arriving prior to the designated meeting time and remaining for the full meeting.
The schedule is maintained by James or a designated lab member and posted in the [SharePoint folder linked here](https://pitt.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/mckonelab2/Shared%20Documents/Meetings/Group%20Meeting?csf=1&web=1&e=YkBIfx).
All lab members who are fully onboarded should also automatically receive an electronic calendar invitation to the weekly meeting - contact James if you have not received this.

Visual aids for group meeting presentations (e.g., PowerPoint slides) should be also be archived using the SharePoint directory linked above, along with any notes that are generated from meeting participants, e.g., from discussion of important lab business or feedback to a particular lab member giving a practice talk.

## One-on-one meetings

As the primary direct research mentor for every lab member, James maintains a policy of offering _at least one hour of one-on-one mentorship time per week_ to each member of our research group each week. 
The only exceptions are for time periods during which James is on vacation or otherwise absent from work for an extended period.
Every lab member is entitled to this time, but you are individually responsible for scheduling (or rescheduling) and administrating these meetings. 

The current approach that most lab members are using for weekly check-ins with James comprises an approach we call **O3 meetings** (O3 is short for "one-on-one"). 
Preparation and execution of these meetings are structured as follows:

* Identify a mutually agreeable time interval to meet with James each week
* Generate a digital calendar appointment and send it to James (to make sure he has it in his schedule)
* Complete an O3 meeting agenda using the [designated template stored in SharePoint](https://pitt.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/mckonelab2/Shared%20Documents/Meetings/O3%20Meetings/McKoneLab%20O3%20Agenda%20Template.docx?d=w715f1e60e0a044c7bc7a37d34b255ff4&csf=1&web=1&e=Klblfa)
* Upload the complete agenda to your [personal O3 meeting folder in SharePoint](https://pitt.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/mckonelab2/Shared%20Documents/Meetings/O3%20Meetings?csf=1&web=1&e=eSiduJ) no less than 18 hours before your meeting 
* James will make every effort to review your agenda the evening or morning before you meet, so plan your actual meeting time accordingly

**Important note:** O3 meetings will only be held if James has been provided an agenda - no agenda, no meeting.

If you wish to structure regular meetings with James in a different way, or if you prefer to forgo regular meetings entirely in favor of meeting with him only on an as-need basis, feel free to pursue alterantive arrangements with him.

## Other meeting types

Lab members are encouraged and/or required to participate in a handful of other types of regular meetings.
Several types are outlined below.
You are strongly encouraged

### Ad-hoc meetings

James maintains, as best he can, an open-door policy toward meeting with students on an as-needed basis.
Feel free to send James a message or to drop by his office if you are in need of some additional discussion on short notice.

### Coadviser meetings

Students who are coadvised by James and another faculty member may choose to schedule regular meetings with both mentors in addition to O3 meetings.
Alternatively, you are welcome to organize your O3 meetings in a way that facilitates attendance by each of your mentors.
Scheduling and administrating these meetings is the responsibility of the student and not the mentors, and the meeting agenda is also left to your discretion.

### Project meetings

Many of our funded grants are collaborative and entail regular meetings of all project participants.
Nowadays most of these meetings are held virtually, and frequencies vary from once every few weeks to one or two time per year.
Each lab member is responsible for familiarizing yourself with your responsibilities to attend these meetings based on your contributions and sources of research funding.

### Departmental or school-wide meetings

Our department hosts various regular meetings related to professional development and mentorship that lab members are more than welcome to attend.
Most of the governing entities for these types of meetings (ChE department, professional organizations like AICHE) maintain mailing lists and/or public schedules to disseminate times and locations of these meetings - be sure to make sure you are added to these lists or know which websites to visit for updates.
It is important for you to plan ahead and coordinate your participation in a way that minimizes conflicts with lab activities as best you can.
