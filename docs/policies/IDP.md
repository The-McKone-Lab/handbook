# Individual Development Plans

## Overview

McKone lab members are required to create and regularly update an Individual Development Plan (IDP) to be discussed with James at regular intervals. 
The purpose of the IDP is to make sure that you are taking time regularly to think about your educational and professional goals and to what extent the day-to-day work you are doing in our lab is helping you reach those goals.
Documenting your plan in writing also makes it easier to track your progress and identify areas in need of improvement or perhaps change directions, as appropriate.
Numerous employers of every type rely on IDPs or very similar approaches to track professional development, so developing these materials as a trainee is useful to make it that much easier to continue these practices when you move on into a professional role.

Maintaining an IDP for our lab requires that you complete a series of four activities followed by a 1-2 hour discussion with James.
Each of these activities is described in the sections below.
Lab members should expect to complete this exercise about twice per year, starting in the second or third term of your affiliation with our lab.

## Assembling your IDP portfolio

### Update your CV or resume

This task is pretty self-explanatory, and there are numerous resources available on the web to help you develop, organize, and format a CV or resume.
A key element of this task, though, is thinking carefully about how your CV or resume should be customized to match your professional objectives.
For example, crafting a resume for an industrial R&D position generally means documenting evidence that you have the requisite qualifiations and skills, whereas CVs for academic jobs tend to emphasize quantifiable metrics of success like publications, presentations, etc.
If you are interested in taking this exercise a step further, consider crafting one version of your CV or resume that reflects your development to the present day, and then create a second one that includes hypothetical entries covering what you hope to accomplish by the time you exit your current position at Pitt.

### Reflect on your goals and professional development

Reflective thinking is absolutely vital for success in training and professional advancement.
This IDP exercise is intended to provide a structured way for you to reflect on your professional goals and your progress to reaching them, along with opportunities to provide feedback to James about what you consider to be going well or not so well with your work and interpersonal relationships in our lab.
To complete the exercise, download [this template called the Professional Development Worksheet](https://pitt.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/mckonelab2/Shared%20Documents/Handbook/assets/public/Professional%20Development%20Worksheet.docx?d=wb376078ded5747e391282636a64d6b5c&csf=1&web=1&e=eZNfdz) and fill it out by answering each of the questions listed in bold.
Be prepared to discuss your answers in a meeting with James.

### Complete a technical self-assessment

Alongside the  has developed a comprehensive document laying out a set of learning objectives for lab researchers covering various types of skills of relevance for lab researchers, such as reading the research literature, designing experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting your findings in written and oral formats.
To complete this self-evaluation exercise, download [this worksheet entitled Learning Objectives for Lab Researchers](https://pitt.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/mckonelab2/Shared%20Documents/Handbook/assets/unused/Learning%20Objectives%20for%20Lab%20Researchers%20Rubric.docx?d=wa145a7c4f4634b8ca3849364c8816cd0&csf=1&web=1&e=92GDPw), which is organized in the form of an assessment rubric.
Fill it out by indicating, for each of the skills listed in the leftmost column, which of the descriptions to the right most accurately reflects your present state of development.

### Compile and export a lab notebook excerpt

Your lab notebook is the most complete and comprehensive record of your work in our lab.
Thus, it is absolutely imperitive to ensure your notebook is being maintained rigorously.
It should also the most accurate reflection of the type and amount of effort that you are putting into various lab tasks, which makes it useful for discussing ways to further improve your approach to lab work.
Thus, you should bundle together with your IDP materials an excerpt from your lab notebook extending back one month prior to the present date.
If you are following our [standard lab notebook guidelines](../professionalTraining/documentingWork.md), this should be as simple as exporting a PDF copy of your OneDrive notebook.
If you have made arrangements to keep a lab notebook using a different mechanism, it is up to you to generate a suitable substitute. 

## IDP Meetings with James

As noted above, every 6 months or so James will notify the lab it is time to update and discuss individual development plans.
This notification will go out with a solicitation for each lab member to claim a timeslot to discuss your IDP materials.
Once you have scheduled a meeting, spend some time completing the tasks above and bundle the resulting materials together into a portfolio comprising your most recently updated IDP documentation.
The full portfolio should be delivered to James digitally by whatever means you wish no less than 48 hours before your designated meeting time.
Note that we don't use SharePoint to transfer these materials because all files stored in our SharePoint server are visible to all lab members, and IDP materials should remain private by default.

During your IDP meeting, James will go through all the materials you provided and offer his feedback as to whether he considers you to be on track to meet your professional objectives.
You will also have opportunities to bring up qeustions, concerns, or any other discussion points related to "big picture" aspects of your own development or how you think things are going for our lab as a whole.

As a final note, these IDP exercises were built to provide regular structured opportunities to think reflectively and give & receive feedback, but you are very welcome to discuss any aspects of your professional development whenever you want.
