# Lab Safety Policies

We make it the highest possible priority to provide and maintain a safe working environment.
The university and department have a robust set of safety policies that apply to all research groups.
The following section discusses additional safety policies that are in effect for our lab.

Note that this handbook section discusses general safety policies, whereas the [onboarding](onboarding.md) section covers safety training requirements.

## Expectations for safe behavior

The university and department have established general rules for safe behavior when working in the laboratory. 
We have established our own rules for best practices in the McKone lab, which in some cases exceed the requirements of the department. 
In the (unlikely) event that the rules outlined below come into conflict with those of the department or university, the departmental or university rules take precedent.

### Deploy safety equipment

Safety equipment, including fire extinguishers, showers, eye washes, spill kits, and the like are located throughout our laboratory spaces. It is imperative that each group member become familiar with the use of each of these pieces of equipment as well as their locations in the laboratory spaces. A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to find your way to a nearby shower, eye wash, or fire extinguisher within a few seconds even with your eyes closed!

### Use personal protective equipment

With regard to personal protective equipment (PPE), McKone lab
researchers are expected to wear, at minimum, a fire-retardant lab coat,
safety glasses, and closed-toed shoes at all times when in the
laboratory space, without exception. Keep long hair tied back so that
it stays well away from the face, behind the shoulders, and inside the
lab coat. Similarly, cumbersome jewelry such as necklaces and large
rings should not be worn because they may come into contact with
hazardous substances or decrease dexterity. You are also
strongly recommended to wear long pants and chemically resistant shoes
(e.g. leather, rubber, or thick canvas) in the lab. Avoid wearing
fabrics with a high content of synthetics such as polyester or nylon, as
they can increase risk in emergencies such as fires or chemical
spills.

Disposable gloves (e.g., nitrile or latex) should be worn when actively working with chemicals, materials, or equipment
that may be considered hazardous. It is important to keep in mind that
even innocuous materials (e.g., deionized water bottles) and surfaces
(e.g., computer keyboards, drawer handles) kept in the lab are likely to have come in
contact with irritating or hazardous substances. Therefore you are encouraged to wear gloves at all
times when working in the lab space. Judicious hand-washing when exiting
the lab is also a must.

Additional PPE may be required for safely operating certain pieces of
equipment or carrying out specific procedures. For example, thick
neoprene gloves are necessary for safely adding and removing glassware
from caustic or corrosive cleaning solutions such as base baths
(concentrated alkali in water and alcohol). These additional PPE
requirements should be visibly posted on or near the relevant equipment
and specified in operating procedure documentation.

### Avoid contamination

It is crucially important to minimize transfer of hazardous materials
and equipment from the lab space to public spaces. To this end,
*always* remove gloves before handling door knobs and
exiting the lab. If it is necessary to transport chemicals outside the
lab, the best procedure is to take off one glove for handling keys, door
knobs, elevator buttons, etc., and to keep one hand gloved for handling
chemical containers. Similarly, if you are using a physical laboratory
notebook that moves back and forth between the lab and public areas,
please make every effort to keep it as clean as possible.

### Don't trust PPE alone

Proper use of PPE is crucial for safe operation in the lab. 
However, no amount of physical safeguards can fully protect a researcher from inherently dangerous practices. 
New equipment and procedures always warrant a careful review of best practices with regard to safety. 
If you have any questions or concerns about safe practices in the lab, please consult colleagues and/or James. 
Similarly, if you are concerned that a colleague is behaving in an unsafe way, it is imperative that you either bring it up directly with them or report to James **immediately**

### Avoid common pitfalls

One of the most common and insidious sources of unsafe behavior is
complacency that often results from repetition. Researchers are encouraged to take
consistent breaks from lab work, especially work that involves
repetitive tasks. Ideally you should be taking breaks of at least 10--15
minutes every 1--2 hours that you spend doing any single task, including
writing at your desk! For repetitive lab work, more consistent
mini-breaks of perhaps a minute or two to deliberately divert and then
re-establish your concentration will help avoid mistakes and mishaps.

Two other common dangerous laboratory practices are
tired and working alone. Under no circumstances are McKone lab members
to run experiments when they have had inadequate sleep or when they are
very ill. Keep in mind that medical research has suggested that going
more than 20 hours without sleep causes cognitive deficits comparable to
alcohol intoxication [^1]. Neither should anyone ever work with hazardous
materials or equipment when alone in the lab space. This is true
regardless of the ease of the procedure, the researcher’s competency,
the time of day, or the proximity of colleagues or emergency personnel.
If you find yourself in a situation where you are the only one planning
to carry out experiments in the lab space, at the very least make
arrangements for a colleague to be nearby and to check on your status at
regular intervals.

## Safety training and access to lab resources

Safe use of lab resources–including chemicals, equipment, and supplies–requires knowledge of the working principles/properties of the resource and training for each user. 
For the purposes of this handbook, we define "resource" broadly to encompass everything available to use in our lab space, whereas "tools" are non-consumable resources like lab equipment, instruments, and supplies.

Each type of resource in our lab has one or more designated administrators who are allowed to train novice users. 
These trainings are to be completed on an as-needed basis with another lab member who is responsible for the care and maintenance of the resource or otherwise highly knowledgable about its function.
This requirement extends not just to analytical instruments, but to all lab resources, including chemicals (chemical safety training is completed as a prerequisite for lab access for everyone) and supplies like repeating pipettors and lab balances.

In most cases, training procedures for lab tools follow a model of three repetitions in the progression "I do; we do; you do."
This means the trainee first watches the administrator operate the tool, then the trainee and administrator operate the tool together, and finally the trainee operates the tool alone with supervision from the administrator.
After demonstrating safe and effective operation of the tool alone, the user is considered to be trained.

Researchers are **never** allowed to use any lab resource for which they have not been trained. 
Regardless of training status, every user must follow safe operating procedures and posted rules at all times.
Failure to comply with rules and operating procedures may result in revocation of your "trained" status at the discretion of an administrator, effectively prohibiting you from using the resource. 
If your trained status is revoked, you must consult with an administrator before you may resume using a resource. 

Note that because our lab has been relatively small to date, we have not maintained a formal log of training status for lab members. 
Unless this policy changes, lab members are expected to follow our training policies on your honor.

## Zero tolerance

We maintain a **zero tolerance** policy for lab safety policy violations or failures to follow proscribed operating procedures.
This means any and all unsafe behavior will be addressed via a response that is intended to match on the severity of the circumstances.
For minor safety violations, you will be required to speak with the administrator in charge of the equipment or materials that were treated unsafely (or with James) to discuss proper procedures. 
Use of the lab or instrument may resume when the administrator is satisfied that you will behave safely in the future.

For moderate violations or repeated minor violations of lab safety rules, access to the laboratory and/or instrument will be revoked. 
Use can resume only upon verbal or written authorization from *both* a laboratory/instrument administrator and James.

Severe violations or repeated moderate violations of safety rules will result in an indefinite ban from use of the equipment, apparatus, or lab space in question. 
This may prevent you from meeting your responsibilities or making adequate progress toward degree completion, in which case James will very likely counsel you to leave our group.
