# Safety

We make it the highest possible priority to provide and maintain a safe
working environment.
The university and department have a robust set of safety policies that apply to all research groups.
The following section discusses additional safety policies that are in effect for the McKone lab.

## Equipment and Tools

Safe operation of equipment and tools requires knowledge of the working
principles of the apparatus and training for each user. Each piece of
equipment administrated by our research lab has one or more designated
administrators who are allowed to train novice users. These trainings are to be
scheduled directly with the equipment administrator.

In general, training procedures follow a model of three repetitions in
the progression "I do; we do; you do."
This means that the trainee first watches the administrator operate the equipment, then the trainee and administrator operate the equipment together, and finally the trainee operates the equipment alone with supervision from the administrator.
After safely and successfully operating the equipment alone, the user is considered to be trained.

Researchers are **never** allowed to use any instrument for which they
have not been trained. Regardless of training status, every user must
obey all standard operating procedures and posted rules at all times.
Failure to comply with rules and operating procedures may result in
revocation of your “trained" status at the discretion of an
administrator, effectively prohibiting you from using the instrument. If
your trained status is revoked, you must consult with an administrator
before you may resume using an instrument. Additionally, users who have
been trained on an instrument but have not used it for a long period of
time may be asked to repeat their training.

## Laboratory and Personal Safety Equipment

The university and department have established general rules for use of
safety equipment when working in the laboratory. We have established our
own rules for best practices in the McKone lab, which in some cases
exceed the requirements of the department. In the (unlikely) event that
the rules outlined below come into conflict with those of the department
or university, the departmental or university rules take precedent.

Safety equipment, including fire extinguishers, showers, eye washes, spill kits, and the like are located throughout our laboratory spaces. It is imperative that each group member become familiar with the use of each of these pieces of equipment as well as their locations in the laboratory spaces. A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to find your way to a nearby shower, eye wash, or fire extinguisher within a few seconds even with your eyes closed!

With regard to personal protective equipment (PPE), McKone lab
researchers are expected to wear, at minimum, a fire-retardant lab coat,
safety glasses, and closed-toed shoes at all times when in the
laboratory space, without exception. Keep long hair tied back so that
it stays well away from the face, behind the shoulders, and inside the
lab coat. Similarly, cumbersome jewelry such as necklaces and large
rings should not be worn because they may come into contact with
hazardous substances or decrease dexterity. You are also
strongly recommended to wear long pants and chemically resistant shoes
(e.g. leather, rubber, or thick canvas) in the lab. Avoid wearing
fabrics with a high content of synthetics such as polyester or nylon, as
they can increase risk in emergencies such as fires or chemical
spills.

Disposable gloves (e.g., nitrile or latex) should be worn when actively working with chemicals, materials, or equipment
that may be considered hazardous. It is important to keep in mind that
even innocuous materials (e.g., deionized water bottles) and surfaces
(e.g., computer keyboards, drawer handles) kept in the lab are likely to have come in
contact with irritating or hazardous substances. Therefore you are encouraged to wear gloves at all
times when working in the lab space. Judicious hand-washing when exiting
the lab is also a must.

It is crucially important to minimize transfer of hazardous materials
and equipment from the lab space to public spaces. To this end,
*always* remove gloves before handling door knobs and
exiting the lab. If it is necessary to transport chemicals outside the
lab, the best procedure is to take off one glove for handling keys, door
knobs, elevator buttons, etc., and to keep one hand gloved for handling
chemical containers. Similarly, if you are using a physical laboratory
notebook that moves back and forth between the lab and public areas,
please make every effort to keep it as clean as possible.

Additional PPE may be required for safely operating certain pieces of
equipment or carrying out specific procedures. For example, thick
neoprene gloves are necessary for safely adding and removing glassware
from caustic or corrosive cleaning solutions such as base baths
(concentrated alkali in water and alcohol). These additional PPE
requirements should be visibly posted on or near the relevant equipment
and specified in operating procedure documentation.

Proper use of PPE is crucial for safe operation in the lab. However, no
amount of physical safeguards can fully protect a researcher from
inherently dangerous practices. New equipment and procedures always
warrant a careful review of best practices with regard to safety. If you
have any questions or concerns about safe practices in the lab, please
consult colleagues and/or Prof. McKone. Similarly, if you are concerned
that a colleague is behaving in an unsafe way, please report it to a
senior lab/staff member or Prof. McKone immediately!

One of the most common and insidious sources of unsafe behavior is
complacency that often results from repetition. Researchers are encouraged to take
consistent breaks from lab work, especially work that involves
repetitive tasks. Ideally you should be taking breaks of at least 10--15
minutes every 1--2 hours that you spend doing any single task, including
writing at your desk! For repetitive lab work, more consistent
mini-breaks of perhaps a minute or two to deliberately divert and then
re-establish your concentration will help avoid mistakes and mishaps.

Two other common dangerous laboratory practices are
tired and working alone. Under no circumstances are McKone lab members
to run experiments when they have had inadequate sleep or when they are
very ill. Keep in mind that medical research has suggested that going
more than 20 hours without sleep causes cognitive deficits comparable to
alcohol intoxication [^1]. Neither should anyone ever work with hazardous
materials or equipment when alone in the lab space. This is true
regardless of the ease of the procedure, the researcher’s competency,
the time of day, or the proximity of colleagues or emergency personnel.
If you find yourself in a situation where you are the only one planning
to carry out experiments in the lab space, at the very least make
arrangements for a colleague to be nearby and to check on your status at
regular intervals.

## Consequences for Unsafe Behavior

We operate on a sliding scale of tolerance for safety policy violations or failures to follow proscribed operating procedures, depending on the severity of the circumstances.
For minor safety violations, you will be required to speak with the administrator in charge of the equipment or materials that were treated unsafely (or with James) to discuss proper procedures. Use of the lab or instrument may resume when the administrator is satisfied that you will behave safely in the future.

For moderate violations or repeated minor violations of lab safety
rules, access to the laboratory and/or instrument will
be revoked. Use can resume only upon verbal or written authorization
from *both* a laboratory/instrument administrator and Prof. McKone.

Severe violations or repeated moderate violations of safety rules will result in an indefinite ban from use of the equipment, apparatus, or lab space in question. This may prevent you from meeting your responsibilities or making adequate progress toward degree completion, in which case James will counsel you to significantly revise your research plan or to leave our group.
