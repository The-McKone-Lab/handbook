To be more specific, each lab notebook entry needs to contain a complete record of the work you have done and all the thinking that went along with it. </p> <p>In practice, this means every entry should be indexed to a date and include some kind of list (acceptable) or narrative description (better) of every step of every experiment you did that day. Using as an example a hypothetical lab session in which you collected several dozen sets of electrochemical current versus voltage data, this doesn't mean you have to have to plot every one of those datasets. But it does mean that if you collected 3 consecutive measurements that were similar and only want to plot the third one in your notebook, you must include in your notes that you are only including one of three datasets that were collected. Thus, your narrative description should be sufficiently detailed to account for all the raw data that results from each experiment you attempt. </p> <p>Documentation should be clear and complete enough to facilitate reproduction or analysis by another researcher with a comparable skill level. A good rule of thumb is to imagine yourself opening your notebook to a random entry 6 months after it was written, such that your specific memory of the day has faded. You should be able to use the notebook entry alone to accurately reproduce the experiment and achieve comparable results. In fact, in many cases this is exactly what researchers do when it comes to collecting a few final datasets to round out a manuscript or a thesis.</p> <p>You also need to document every technical aspect of your experiments. This means writing down the names, manufacturers, purities, and lot numbers of the chemicals you use. It also means describing (and ideally taking photographs) all of your experimental apparatus. Note, however, that this usually only needs to be done once\u2014the first time you use that chemical or apparatus. After that, you can simply reference back to the prior entry that gives the relevant experimental details, i.e. \"see description from May 13 of this year for full details of the apparatus.\"</p> <p>Data analysis (which includes preparing and discussing plots, diagrams etc.) should be initiated immediately after you complete the corresponding experiment (the same day if possible), and it should be clearly documented in your notebook. There are a lot of excellent software packages that can be used for quantitative and statistical data analysis and visualization. James likes to prioritize use of free and open tools, so preference would be to use Python libraries (e.g., SciPy, NumPy, Pandas) or the R software package for analysis. Other options include Matlab, Mathematica, Origin, Sigmaplot, and Excel, all of which can be obtained for free or at a discount for academic use.</p> <p>For every experiment, you need to provide an explanation for why you ran the experiment and your (preliminary) interpretation of the results. The point here is not to try to make your lab notebook look like a published research article; rather, the point is for you to fully document not just your data, but the thinking that went along with the data. This is tedious, and it will be awkward if you have not done it before, but it is extremely important!</p> <p>Finally, you should be using your lab notebook to write reflectively about your work. This means you can and should create lab notebook entries from time to time that don't have any new data at all.

Here you should walk the audience through the technical content of your research by describing (a) what was the technical work you carried out, (b) what were the main results, and (c) how those results support or refute your hypotheses or inform your answers to the questions that you sought out to address. Use visual aids, including graphical and tabular data, schematic images, and photographs to convey the qualitative and quantitative content of your work.</p> <p>It will also likely be necessary to spend some time describing or even teaching about the techniques that you used before discussing the associated results. Keep in mind that even the most seasoned researchers generally don't mind being reminded how a particular tool or technique works. This type of explanation will also go a long way to establishing your credibility as an expert in the field, which makes the rest of your discussion more believable.</p> <p>A few different organizational approaches for presenting technical work are quite common. You may choose, for example, to present a story arc structure, where research results are discusses in the context of an overarching challenge that you were hoping to overcome, where each piece of new data either helped or hindered. This style works well to keep the audience engaged, and makes it easy to interject your own emotional content and humor into your lecture. Another approach might be to present each key conclusion as a headline, followed by a discussion of the data and discussion that justify the conclusion. This approach is helpful in that it makes absolutely clear to the audience what are the main points of your talk. Other organizational approaches may also be reasonable, depending on your personality, the audience, and the content of the talk.</p> <p>For longer presentations (45 minutes to an hour or more), it is usually helpful to break the body section into several smaller subsections. Each subsection should have a similar structure, and they should be set off from one another in a clear way using verbal and/or visual cues. Connections can then be drawn between subsections after they have been individually presented. In this case, there is often a clear logical way to order the subsections that will allow you to build in complexity over the course of the talk.</p>"},{"location":"professionalTraining/givingPresentations/#3-conclusion","title":"3. Conclusion","text":"<p>The concluding section will vary in length, depending on the scope of the talk. This is your chance to summarize and emphasize the most important messages of your presentation. Although it may feel redundant, it is perfectly appropriate (and even helpful) to directly repeat key points that you made earlier in the lecture. In this context, keep in mind that repetition is crucial for memory, so the points that you want the audience to remember should be stated at least two to three times over the course of the talk. It is also helpful to include one or more visual aids corresponding to your main conclusions. These can either be new graphics that synthesize multiple key points, or repetitions of images that appeared earlier in the talk.  </p> <p>At the very end of the talk, it is customary to include acknowledgements where you should mention and thank everyone who was involved in the conceptual and practical execution of the research, including sources of funding or fellowship support. It is helpful to compile these acknowledgements into a visual aid, which might include bullet lists of names or (even better) photos or logos of the people and organizations who were involved. You may need to seek permission prior to using photos or logos, however.</p>"},{"location":"professionalTraining/givingPresentations/#the-process-of-writing-the-talk","title":"The Process of Writing the Talk","text":"<p>The next key concern is how to actually go about drafting and revising the content of your presentation. As noted earlier, it is often easier to focus on the slides at the expense of what you are actually going to say, but it is important to avoid this tendency. A general approach to preparing the talk content and visual aids might include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Assemble the data of interest in the form of rough figures and diagrams; even digitized hand sketches will do for a first draft!</li> <li>Organize the rough figures into a visual outline of the talk. Many of these figures will likely make it into the final talk in some form.</li> <li>Draft a written narrative outline, which could be attached directly to the visual aid file(s) or included as a separate text file.</li> <li>Reorganize the visuals as needed, and adapt the written narrative into appropriate headings and presenter notes.</li> <li>Construct title, outline, conclusions, and acknowledgement slides to bookend the talk. This will complete the first draft.</li> <li>Iteratively revise the figures, diagrams, slide order, and narrative outline to work toward a final draft.</li> </ul> <p>In almost all cases, the goal should be to tell the story of your research project with as few extraneous details as possible. It is tempting to try to dazzle the audience with a lot of data under the expectation that conclusions are convincing based on the volume of results alone. Taking this approach, though, prevents you from giving sufficient discussion for any single piece of data which, ironically, can lead the audience to feel unconvinced. A good rule of thumb is never to show or discuss anything that you are not prepared to explain in detail if an audience member were to ask you about it. You should also plan to refer directly, in some way, to every visual aid you use in the talk, so avoid including graphics, data, or images for purely aesthetic purposes or that the audience will need to puzzle out for themselves.</p> <p>A handful of additional recommendations on talk contents are as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>In addition to helping introduce your topic, an outline also gives the audience a sense of where is the beginning, middle, and end of the lecture. For example, audience members will get very nervous if the first out of five points on your outline takes 80% of the allotted time to discuss. Therefore, it is a good idea to structure any outline visual aids so that the amount of text/graphical space given to a topic corresponds the amount of time that part of the talk will require, rather than the relative intellectual weight you assign.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid generic headings! The worst case is headings that simply state the technique that was used to collect the associated data. Better headings state in a few words the main conclusion you wish to draw from the data, or somehow draw the audience into the process of carrying out the work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Diagrams that work well in print very often need to be revised for oral presentations. Fonts usually need to be enlarged in order to be clearly visible from the back of the room. Also graphical content needs to be simplified for talks compared to papers, because the audience needs to be able to digest the data in just a few moments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repetition can be very effective, when used judiciously. For example, you can prepare and remind your audience for the data they will digest by including simple graphical representations of those data in the outline and conclusion slides. This is a great way to give visual interest to presentation slides and to make your talk more memorable. Main points can also be repeated for emphasis (perhaps even verbatim) verbally or in visual aids, especially when multiple datasets clearly point to a single conclusion.</p> </li> <li> <p>As with repetition, dynamic visual aids can also be effective, but only when they are used appropriately and seamlessly. Animations or videos showing dynamic data naturally introduce a temporal element into the delivery, and it is important to time them well so as not to disrupt the natural flow of the talk. Another dynamic approach is to have elements of the visual aid appear and/or disappear in synchronization with the associated verbal discussion. This can be very effective in directing the audience\u2019s attention to the point you wish to discuss, but too much appearing and disappearing of visual aids can make a presentation feel frantic.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is easy to get bogged down in the aesthetic aspects of your visual aids, but effort placed in this area leads to rapidly diminishing returns. Also, while everyone is entitled to their personal preferences regarding typeface, whitespace, and use of colors, you should never sacrifice legibility for artfulness. Thus, it is generally preferable to keep the talk aesthetically neutral.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"professionalTraining/givingPresentations/#prepare-the-delivery","title":"Prepare the delivery","text":"<p>Always remember the following when preparing to deliver a presentation: the focus of the talk should be the speaker, and not the visual aids. After all, if visuals alone were sufficient to deliver the message, researchers wouldn\u2019t need to talk to one another at all! If you keep this general principle in mind throughout preparation of your delivery, it will help you avoid some of the most significant pitfalls.</p> <p>A very thorough preparation for an oral presentation might involve initially writing out a complete \u201cscript\u201d encompassing one version of what you want to say. Writing and then reading from a script will allow you to define and critically assess the content of the talk. A script is also handy for making initial estimates of how long the talk (and individual parts of the talk) will take to deliver. Running a few initial practice sessions with a script that you are happy with will also help you remember the main points that correspond to each visual aid, so that you won\u2019t need to be constantly referring to notes during the real lecture. When coming up with an initial script, avoid the very common tendency to use jargon and complex sentence structures, because natural language and a conversational style often go over much better than an overly technical approach.</p> <p>Once you feel the talk has been adequately prepared and planned, practice it a handful of times in a few different stages. First, read the script silently a few times while contemporaneously looking through the associated visual aids. Then transition to speaking out loud alone a few times. During this stage you should transition away from reading from a script, and rather rely on your memory and a few cue words written on cards (or the \u201cpresenter view\u201d notes on your slide software). Next, find an empty space that more closely resembles the presentation environment (e.g., a conference room or classroom with a projector) and practice the full talk alone using only the cues that you plan to use in the actual talk. Finally, invite friends and/or colleagues to listen to a real \u201cdry run\u201d of the talk, and solicit their feedback on the technical and/or aesthetic aspects of the presentation.</p> <p>As you practice your presentation, continue to make revision to fine-tune the visual aids and your delivery. Also, be aware that it is actually possible to practice too much! If you get the point rote memorization of the associated words and inflections, you can actually deliver the talk without your brain making an active connection between the words and the content. This will make you very inflexible and easy to \u201cthrow off\u201d during the presentation. It is better to stop practicing while the content still feels at least a little bit fresh.</p> <p>In addition to visual aids and the verbal content of the presentation, nonverbal indicators are important in the delivery of a presentation. These include body language like gestures, posture, and movement, as well as whether and how you indicate specific parts of visual aids, e.g., using a laser pointer. There are many examples of good and bad nonverbal cues during a presentation, but in general the best strategy is simply to practice in front of a live audience and solicit their honest feedback about anything you are doing that is unclear, distracting, or off-putting.</p>"},{"location":"professionalTraining/givingPresentations/#give-the-talk","title":"Give the talk","text":"<p>Giving the final research presentation could be as easy as simply doing exactly what you have practiced. In reality, practice talks never adequately approximate the environment of giving a real research presentation, whether it is a group meeting presentation, a talk at a conference, or a seminar as part of a job interview. In fact, the best scientific talks are almost always the ones where the speaker has given the presentation publicly to an evaluative (and perhaps unfriendly) audience several times. This is definitely an area in which practice makes perfect.</p> <p>When delivering the final lecture, make an effort exude confidence and excitement about the work. It is common, especially for young researchers, to feel overwhelmed or threatened when giving a presentation to senior (or perhaps renowned) colleagues. Keep in mind, though, that regardless of who is in the audience, you are the single person in the room with the most complete and intimate knowledge of the work that you are discussing. It is also highly likely that some members of the audience will have never considered the conclusions that you are discussing. This is your opportunity to get them excited about your work.</p> <p>Most formal presentations include opportunities for the audience to ask questions, either contemporaneously or after the lecture is complete. When someone asks a question, be sure to take adequate time to actually absorb and consider their words. You can ask clarification questions to make sure you understand what is being asked. Try to keep the answers brief and specific to the question that was posed, in order to allow for as many questions to be fielded as possible. In the case of contemporaneous questions, it is fine to politely defer the answer to a later point in the lecture, if you a feel that it will be addressed in the course of your planned remarks. If a question is posed that for which you don\u2019t know the answer, it is always better to answer honestly with \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d or \u201cWe hadn\u2019t considered that,\u201d than to try to dodge the question or come up with a haphazard response on the fly. If a question is posed that you don\u2019t understand, or if the answer will be necessarily lengthy, it is also fine to politely defer until after the talk, where you can speak at length in person. This strategy can also be used to minimize discomfort for you and the audience in the unlikely event that a questioner is being hostile.</p> <p>Anxiety about oral presentations is inevitable, especially for novices or in circumstances where the stakes are high (e.g. a job interview). It is good to have a strategy for controlling nerves. One potentially effective strategy is to take a \u201cmindfulness\u201d approach that involves accepting that nervousness (which is really an activation of the body\u2019s fight-or-flight response) is not indicative of danger, but rather it is a common and normal reaction to being the center of attention. Hopefully this will help diminish the emotional intensity of your nerves. You can couple this mental/emotional relaxation with physical relaxation exercises like deep breathing or stretching. Paying attention to your breathing is also helpful during the talk, as it facilitates good pacing and helps keep the audience relaxed as well. It is far more common for inexperienced speakers to move too quickly than too slowly. Having a glass or bottle of water can be helpful too, as it provides an excuse to insert some space between sentences.</p> <p>To conclude, consider for a moment what is your ultimate goal in delivering a research presentation. One goal might be that the talk itself will help advance the associated research through new ideas, discussion, collaborative opportunities, etc. Keeping this, or any other goal, in mind throughout the process will help establish a solid trajectory in preparation and execution.</p>"},{"location":"professionalTraining/gradGuide/","title":"Graduate Student Guide","text":"<p>As a graduate student, your primary goal is to accumulate knowledge, experience, and research accomplishments that collectively merit awarding of a graduate degree (master\u2019s and/or PhD). You will deepen your knowledge through coursework, advance the field of chemical engineering through research, and contribute to the missions of the CPE department through teaching and service.</p> <p>The specific requirements for graduate studies in CPE at Pitt are enumerated in two bulletins: the SSOE graduate bulletin and the chemical and petroleum engineering graduate bulletin. To be awarded a graduate degree, students will need to complete those requirements and demonstrate substantial progress in original research as reflected in a thesis/dissertation. For a master\u2019s degree, progress on one primary project is sufficient, whereas for a PhD the dissertation should discuss several research accomplishments. Ideally a master\u2019s student will complete his/her degree in 1\u20132 years and publish at least one paper as a the leading author; ideally PhD students will finish in 5 years and publish three or more papers as the leading authors. These publication guidelines, however, are not absolute requirements. Prof. McKone places a high priority on graduating PhDs within 5 years, and he is very reluctant to keep anyone on for more than 6, regardless of his/her progress toward completion of the degree.</p> <p>For the sake of convenience, it makes sense to classify master\u2019s and PhD students in their first year or two as junior graduate students, and those who have passed their exams and are in their third year or beyond as senior graduate students.</p> <p>The first two years comprise a transition from primarily coursework, which emphasizes well-established principles, toward original research, which emphasizes new ideas. Junior graduate students are encouraged to concentrate on coursework and teaching responsibilities, especially in the first semester or two. In terms of research, try to target one well-defined research project initially. Writing a master\u2019s thesis and/or passing the PhD qualifying exam will require that you can demonstrate a high level of proficiency in the broad principles of chemical engineering and that you have made progress toward original insights in the laboratory.</p> <p>Upon passing the qualifying exam, senior graduate students focus more directly on making progress in the lab. A good way to structure your lab work is to maintain one primary project at all times and to maintain one or more additional \u201cside\" projects. Primary projects are likely to yield lead-author publications, and they will be the main focus of your dissertation. A side project might be a collaboration with a colleague at Pitt or elsewhere, where you are providing some specific expertise or insight, or it might be an original research idea that needs some promising preliminary results before meriting more detailed attention. These efforts will lead to co-authorship on publications, or they may become primary projects later.</p> <p>Along with lab work, graduate students have several other responsibilities. Each student will likely be placed in charge of one or more instruments or apparatus in the lab, which carries the responsibilities of maintenance and training. Senior students should also consider mentoring undergraduates or junior lab members. Graduate students should also be keeping up with the published literature in their area of study, and they should attend research seminars on campus regularly.</p> <p>It is important for graduate students to develop skills in presenting their work to technical and non-technical audiences. Thus, in addition to regular internal group meeting presentations, each student should try to give one or two public research presentations per year, beginning in the second year. There are many opportunities to present research publicly on the Pitt campus or elsewhere in the immediate vicinity (e.g., at local conferences or one of the other universities in Pittsburgh) as part of a poster session or seminar series. Prof. McKone will also try to provide opportunities for each graduate student to attend one or more national conferences (e.g. AICHE, ACS, MRS, Gordon Conference, etc.) during their Pitt tenure. Expenses for trips to conferences will be covered through laboratory funds or travel-specific grants/fellowships, but keep in mind that local meetings are the easiest to fund.</p> <p>Graduate students are also asked to take significant responsibility for writing manuscripts and informal reports. Prof. McKone will work with junior graduate students as closely as needed to draft their first manuscripts, whereas senior graduate students may reach a level of fluency that they will only need editorial input and final approval from Prof. McKone prior to submission. From time to time, Prof. McKone will also ask for brief research reports or graphical data in order to prepare external presentations and progress reports. Grad students need not be directly involved in writing research proposals, but those who are interested in learning more about that process are welcome to contribute upon request.</p> <p>Here are a handful of additional tips for grad students:</p> <ul> <li> <p>As Prof. McKone\u2019s graduate thesis advisor Harry Gray used to say,     \u201cDon\u2019t peak too soon!\" This means don\u2019t get down on     yourself for not having earth-shattering results right away in your     graduate career. Most students don\u2019t really hit their stride until     they are approaching graduation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Begin planning for the qualifying and thesis examinations well ahead     of time---4 months or more for quals and perhaps 9 months or more for     the thesis exam. These events are inevitable sources of stress, but     starting to think about them very early allows you to approach them     at a measured pace.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep your piles small: don\u2019t let un-analyzed data,     unfinished manuscripts, ungraded homework, etc. build up. Many people     find that the thing they least like to do tends to be the very thing     that accumulates, and then it comes to dominate their existence.     Completing each of your major tasks roughly in the order that they     arrive is a good way to keep this from happening.</p> </li> <li> <p>Read a lot of papers! It is amazing how often a few hours spent     reading the published literature can save days of effort in the lab.     Set aside some regular time every week (a few hours at least) to     review the current literature. Also, before starting a new project,     it is advisable to spend as much as several days familiarizing     yourself with the current and historical literature on the topic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t be afraid to take time just to think carefully about your     research projects. Many grad students make the mistake of trying to     run as many experiments as is humanly possible, and in doing so they     fail to plan any single experiment with adequate care. A useful     rule of thumb is that you should learn something useful from every     single experiment you run.</p> </li> <li> <p>Maintain multiple lines of inquiry in the lab. It really stinks when     your main line of research gets \"stuck\" due to some unforeseen     challenge or, even worse, some delay that is out of your     control (e.g. instrument is down). If you follow the model of having     one main project and several minor projects, it becomes easier to     fill in those gaps with work that is productive and hopefully more     satisfying than just waiting to get \"un-stuck.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Be a whole person. Although this was already mentioned in terms of     maintaining a balanced lifestyle, it bears repeating. Nothing leads     to burnout faster or more consistently than acting like an automaton     whose single purpose is to churn out lab work and nothing else.     Cultivate your interests in areas other than your own research,     scientific or otherwise. Grad students are allowed to be real     people!</p> </li> <li> <p>Try as best you can to become intellectually and materially     independent from your peers and from your advisor. The more you can     accomplish without regular input or instructions from others, the     more successful you are likely to be in grad school and beyond.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it\u2019s important to be intellectually independent, try also     to keep in close touch with members of other labs. Engage them in     conversation about your work and theirs. It is easy for university     research labs to become \"silos\" with relatively little     external interaction. This is, for one thing, socially awkward, and     for another it can lead to very narrow and uncreative thinking. So     try to keep the conversation going with your community of peers at     Pitt from your first year right through graduation.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"professionalTraining/meetingsBestPractices/","title":"Best Practices for Planning and Executing Meetings","text":""},{"location":"professionalTraining/meetingsBestPractices/#specify-a-purpose-or-goal","title":"Specify a purpose or goal","text":"<p>To put it simply, one should always approach meetings with a high level of skepticism.

Ideally he/she will leave with an excellent record of publication and service and demonstrable skills that will make for a smooth transition to the next vocational opportunity.</p> <p>A large proportion of my intellectual and physical energy goes into mentoring graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduates in my lab.

My service work includes committee and administrative functions for the CPE department, and I provide broader service to the engineering community, e.g., by organizing and chairing sessions at the annual AICHE meeting. I strongly encourage all graduate students and postdocs to become involved in at least one teaching and service opportunity during their tenure at Pitt, regardless of your vocational goals.</p> <p>Another important area of service is community outreach.

Postdocs also have the most diverse set of plausible goals: some might seek specific research experience for a well-defined employment opportunity; others might be looking to expand their skill set more generally so as to improve future job prospects; others might be interested in taking on administrative or mentorship roles in preparation for future work in academics, government, or industry. Any of these goals is excellent, but it is very important that you communicate your intentions clearly to Prof. McKone beginning during the interview process and continuing well after beginning work in the lab.</p> <p>Postdocs will likely spend between one and three years in the McKone lab. Expectations regarding research effort and output are similar to those of senior graduate students. A good rule of thumb is to focus on at least one primary project and one or more secondary project or collaboration at all times. Postdocs are particularly encouraged to seek out collaborations with other research groups and to integrate their previous research experience with our own so as to expand the group\u2019s expertise. Also as with graduate students, postdocs should be broadly responsible for drafting research reports and manuscripts.</p> <p>Postdocs are strongly encouraged to apply for external research funding through grants and fellowships. Many of these require independent reports to be submitted, and these provide good practice for future work in the academic, government, or industrial sectors. Postdocs should also make an effort to integrate into the research community at Pitt by attending seminars and presenting their research. As with graduate students, Prof. McKone will work to facilitate travel to at least one external conference annually.</p> <p>Most of the time, postdocs are looking to transition from their current position toward long-term employment elsewhere. Therefore it is very important to begin pursuing potential job opportunities at least 6 months to a year before your intended departure. Over the last several years the job market in the chemical sciences has been tightening, and so finding a job often requires a great deal of effort. It is perfectly acceptable to consider the job search as part of your work role as a postdoc. This means that, e.g., traveling for job interviews and working on applications can be considered as productive work time, even at the expense of short-term progress on your research projects. Prof. McKone will put forward as much effort as he can to help you make connections to further your career, whether that means writing recommendation letters, sending you to conferences for networking purposes, or helping to facilitate personal connections.</p> <p>Here are some additional tips and suggestions for postdocs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Seek out regular interactions with more than one research mentor.     For one reason, cross-pollinating ideas between research groups is     fun and rewarding. For another, consider that most employers require     at least three reference letters for applicants. Usually this means     your thesis advisor, your postdoc advisor, and at least one \u201cwild     card\u201c letter writer. The most compelling reference letters usually     come from mentors who know you well and are familiar with your most     recent accomplishments. That said, be careful about becoming     administratively involved in more than one research group, as being     an \u201dofficial\" member of more than one group only works well     if you and both primary investigators are in close agreement about     your responsibilities to each.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is a good idea to keep your CV current and to keep on hand a few business cards with your contact information. You never know when a potential employment opportunity will arise. Nowadays it is also worthwhile to purchase and maintain a simple website that compiles your professional information and provides a way for others to contact you electronically. That way, even if a potential employer loses your business card, she/he can find you using a simple internet search. Social media can also be helpful in this context, but bear in mind that mixing personal and professional interactions on social media can be off-putting for potential employers.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Moderate your self-expectations in the first few months of     the postdoc. The transition from one institution to another is     always jarring, and it usually takes at least 6 months before a     postdoc can attain anywhere near the level of productivity that     she/he sustained at the peak of graduate school. So take it easy     initially and don\u2019t get down on yourself.</p> </li> <li> <p>Plan the content and execution of your research projects carefully.     Since postdocs work on a relatively short time frame, good planning     and careful work are especially important. Be sure to talk to     coworkers and Prof. McKone regularly within your first several     months of postdoctoral work to ensure that your research     plans are likely to lead to productive outcomes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vigorously pursue external research funding. Postdoctoral fellowship     and grant programs are nowadays few and far between, but external     funding significantly increases your flexibility as a postdoc. They     also greatly improve your credibility as an independent thinker,     which most employers find very important. Not to mention the pay is     almost always better!</p> </li> <li> <p>Connect with other postdocs in your field, both locally and nationally. Many of them will remain your colleagues for years to come, and there is no better time to begin building relationships. Keeping in touch with other postdocs can also be helpful in the interest of \u201ccomparing notes\" about employment opportunities and current trends in research. Consider as a relevant example that Prof. McKone was first made aware of the tenure-track opening at Pitt through a personal connection with Prof. Keith, and not through a formal job posting!</p> </li> <li> <p>Actively pursue multiple career options. Many postdocs are targeting a     specific career outcome, but     personal circumstances and external factors can change those plans     in a hurry! Think of it this way: wise career choices are only made     with full awareness of all of the available possibilities. So even     if your goal is, e.g., a position at a national lab, consider     pursuing interviews in industrial labs as well in the interest of     keeping your options open and validating your final decision with     knowledge rather than speculation about the alternatives.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"professionalTraining/readingPapers/","title":"Tips for finding and reading publications","text":"<p>This guide discusses a general approach for finding and reading scientific publications.

A number of online resources are available for searching the published literature by title, topic, author, etc. Two good options are Google Scholar and Web of Science.</li> <li>Use references from an existing publication.

Whether working over the summer or during the school year, undergrads can have a significant impact on our collective efforts, and they will also reap positive benefits for their own intellectual development and career prospects. In general, undergraduate students should keep in mind three goals. First, lab work allows you to diversify and enhance your undergraduate education with hands-on experience. Second, lab work can inform decisions about future education and career objectives. Third, successful lab work can greatly increase your credibility and competitiveness for later educational and career opportunities, especially in STEM-related areas.</p> <p>In general, undergrads will work in close collaboration with one or more graduate or postdoc mentors. These mentorship relationships should be established by mutual interest and explicit agreement to work together. That is, Prof. McKone will not \u201cassign\" undergraduates to work with particular grad students or postdocs; rather he will direct interested students toward lab members who might make a good match with an undergraduate mentee. Undergrad students who are interested in our group are encouraged to contact Prof. McKone or existing group members directly to get this mentorship conversation started.</p> <p>Undergraduate researchers and their mentors should invest significant time up front to create a well-defined research plan. That plan should focus on exposing you to a variety of research tools and methods, and it should clearly delineate research problems and hypotheses to justify and motivate the work. It is important to avoid scenarios where an undergrad researcher simply functions as an spare pair of hands assisting his/her mentor\u2019s work. In most cases it is best to create a brief proposal or outline of the planned research activities to make sure you, your mentor, and Prof. McKone are all on the same page.</p> <p>Regarding specific research projects, two broad categories are natural fits for undergrads. The first is where the undergrad researcher takes on a brand new challenge that the group has not attempted previously. This \u201chigh-risk, high-reward\" research is very exciting, but it might be inadvisable for grad students or postdocs since it is less likely to lead to results that can be published or included in a thesis. This type of project might be perfect for an undergrad who is ambitious and not easily discouraged by unsuccessful or unanticipated outcomes. The second type of project is where the undergrad pursues original work that parallels or expands on that of her/his mentor. For example, if the mentor has been synthesizing and characterizing catalyst materials comprised of elements A and B, the undergraduate mentee might work on catalysts containing elements A and C. Bear in mind that there should always be a coherent rationale for the departure from the mentor\u2019s work, and you should be intellectually and materially responsible for advancing your own work in spite of any overlap with that of your mentor.</p> <p>Since undergraduates enter the lab with a modest amount of previous experience, there are a few additional rules that you are asked to follow. The first rule is that coursework always comes first. We certainly hope that working in our lab will enhance your education, but it should be seen as an extra-curricular or co-curricular activity. Thus it should not directly interfere with your course schedule and commitments. Under no circumstances should an undergraduate lab member forsake course responsibilities (e.g. class attendance, homework) in favor of working in the lab. Neither is lab work a valid excuse for not completing course work. If you are struggling to balance course responsibilities with lab work, please consult with your mentor and/or Prof. McKone to consider modifying your research focus as needed to better accommodate your availability.</p> <p>Undergraduates are also asked to obey a more stringent rule regarding supervision: never work in the lab space without at least one grad student or postdoc also present. The supervising lab member need not be your mentor, nor do they need to explicitly monitor your work, but he/she should be available to help in case you have questions or in the unlikely event of an emergency. This rule means that in some cases undergrads will need to coordinate working hours carefully with other lab members, especially during the school year. Course schedules may dictate that the most convenient time for an undergrad to work might be at odd hours (e.g. after dinner or on weekends). Although it is perfectly fine to work during those times, it is not safe to assume that a grad student or postdoc will always be available to supervise.</p> <p>Undergraduates who are actively working in the McKone group are considered \u201cfull\" lab members, in the sense that they will be provided office space and access to the lab just as with any other researcher to the extent that the department allows. In return, you are required to take full part in lab responsibilities, including cleaning and upkeep of lab and office spaces. You should make arrangements to attend weekly laboratory meetings. You will also be included in the rotation for giving research presentations. In most cases, however, multiple undergraduates will be scheduled for one meeting to allow for shorter talks. If our meetings or other group activities conflict with school or extracurricular responsibilities, accommodations can be made in consultation with Prof. McKone.</p> <p>A few other tips and suggestions for undergraduates are worth mentioning:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Seek out conversations and advice from more than one group member.     Although you will have one or perhaps two formal mentors, many group     members might have useful insights regarding your research project     or helpful advice regarding coursework or future career options.</p> </li> <li> <p>Plan your time in lab carefully. Summer research periods are short     (usually 8\u201310 weeks), and so it is important to avoid hastily     devised forays in directions that end up being unproductive for your     project or your learning. Research during the school year is even     harder, as undergrads usually cannot spend more than a few hours in     the lab at a time. The most important thing to remember in this     context is to always plan ahead and set realistic goals about what     you can accomplish in the time you have available.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prioritize intellectual independence in     your research. This means developing your own working knowledge of     every aspect of your project so that you don\u2019t rely on your mentor     for instructions on what to do next or what results to expect. In     this context, excellent undergraduate researchers can become so     independent that they effectively function as junior grad students. This is a     desirable outcome, but keep in mind that it usually takes multiple     summers and semesters of diligent work to reach that point.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t be afraid to propose new experiments. Grad students,     postdocs, and professors do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Once     you gain some experience in a lab setting, all likelihood is that     you will have interesting ideas of your own that might be     worth pursuing. Talk to your mentor about those ideas and develop a     plan to push the project in directions that you find exciting.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are dissatisfied or not enjoying your work, let someone know.     Sometimes a research project just turns out to be a \u201cdud,\" or maybe     it isn\u2019t right for your temperament. If that is the case, it is     usually very easy to find something different to do. It is possible     that you will simply decide that our research methods and approaches aren\u2019t right     for you, in which case Prof. McKone would be happy to work with you     to consider opportunities in other labs.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"professionalTraining/visitorGuide/","title":"Visiting Researcher Guide","text":"<p>From time to time, we welcome research visitors from other institutions to work in our lab.
